Changelog for MARS
==================
Current changes as of July 2024:
Max playable level is now 20.
Experience required to level up is now based on the d20 table. So current level x1000exp
e.g. Level one to level 2 is 1,000 exp. Level 2 to 3 is 2,000 exp. 3 to 4 is 3,000, 4 to 5 is 4,000 and so on.
so the total amount of exp to reach level 5 is 10,000 exp. 

Level is no longer checked when equipping gear. Gear level is irrelevant. a dagger is a dagger is a dagger. Being
level 1 or level 5000, the dagger should still do the same amount of damage.

Spells have been changed, added, or removed to bring them in line with the Open Gaming License version
of the d20 SRD. If it doesn't exist in D&D, it won't exist in MARS.

Spells and skills have been arranged by class; so no spell casting fighters, and no mages with third-attack.
The only exception being thieves; as they can use scrolls, wands and staves per their SRD counterpart having
"use magic item" as part of the class benefits.

If you have not spotted a theme, the entire MUD is moving in a D&D original campaign setting direction, though
very barebones, as the idea is that anyone can pick up a copy of MARS, compile it, and then focus on building a
world for their players, and not have to worry about coding skills and spells, or any of that. I am attempting
to create the digital equivalent of picking up a copy of the base books for D&D and being able to create your
own unique campaign. The system is already there, you just need to create the world.
