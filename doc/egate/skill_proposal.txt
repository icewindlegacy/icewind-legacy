A skill can have up to three prerequisite skills.  A player's proficiency in
a given skill can never be higher than his proficiency in any of the
prerequisite skills.
The prerequisite skills of course can themselves have prerequisites.

A player cannot use a skill at all unless it has been practiced at least
once.  This applies to prereq skills as well.

Every time a player uses or attempts to use a skill a check should be made
for gaining proficiency in the skill.

A practice session counts as a successful usage of the skill.

If a player gains proficiency through usage, and it would increase the
proficiency above that of a prereq, then proficiency in the prereq is gained
instead.
Optionally, the gain could be discarded.
Optionally, a check could be made for a gain in the prereq rather than the
gain being automatic.

The first time a player practices a skill, their player age will be noted.
Each time the player uses the skill his age will be recorded, overwriting
the previous "last used" age.  These ages can be used to determine how long
a player has known a skill, and to determine when the skill was last used.

A count of each time the player uses or practices the skill will be kept.

Usage of a skill would also count as a usage of all applicable prereqs, ie,
counts and times for prereqs will be adjusted.

When a player attempts to use a skill, his proficiency may be adjusted
downwards through a formula yet to be determined.  Factors in the formula
will be times used, length of time known, time since last usage, and the
difficulty factor for the player's class for the skill.  Each skill may have
a class-independent "forgetfulness factor" or persistence factor, reflecting
for instance the way it's harder to forget how to ride a bicycle than it is
to forget how to perform calculus computations.
