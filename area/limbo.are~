`C    The Story of MARS
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X

Once, in a world far beyond the reach of our reality, there existed a magical 
realm where elves, humans, dwarves, and halflings lived in harmony under the 
watchful eyes of the ancient forests and towering mountains. This was a land of 
wonders and enchantment, filled with magic and myth.

In the heart of this wondrous realm lay the massive obsidian isle, known as the 
`zShadow Isle`X. It had always been a place of darkness, surrounded by legends of 
ancient evils and forbidden necromancy. For centuries, the inhabitants of the 
main continent had kept their distance from this cursed isle, knowing its 
sinister power could corrupt anything it touched.

However, a sinister force had awakened within the `zShadow Isle`X, a powerful 
necromancer named `RMorwen`X who sought to spread his malevolent dominion far and 
wide. Using dark magic fueled by the souls of the departed, he began to extend 
the reach of the `zShadow Isle`X, causing corruption to slowly spread across the 
ocean like a creeping shadow. The once sparkling blue waters turned murky and 
lifeless, and fear gripped the hearts of those living along the coastlines.

In a small elven village, nestled among the ancient trees of the forest, a 
young elf named `GLyra`X sensed the growing darkness. She was gifted with an 
uncommon talent to see the threads of destiny and felt a calling within her 
soul. Disturbed by the visions of the spreading corruption, she knew that she 
had to act.

`GLyra`X embarked on a journey to seek out the Council of Elders, a gathering of 
wise beings from all races who safeguarded the harmony of their world. With a 
heavy heart, she shared her visions and spoke of the impending doom that 
awaited if Morwen's power was not stopped.

The Council listened intently and recognized the gravity of the situation. They 
decided that a fellowship of heroes must be formed to stand against the rising 
darkness. `GLyra`X, with her insight, was chosen to lead the fellowship, and the 
council selected four others to join her quest:

`YTormund`X, a fearless dwarf warrior known for his strength and loyalty.

`PLillian`X, a skilled human mage who had the power to harness the ancient elements.

`OThistlefoot`X, a clever halfling rogue, nimble and quick-witted, with a knack for 
finding hidden paths.

`WA`Yn`wd`Yr`Wo`Ys`X, a wise elder elf skilled in ancient lore and healing magic.

The five companions set out from the elven village and journeyed through vast 
forests, treacherous mountains, and mysterious caves. Along their path, they 
encountered both friends and foes, learning to rely on each other's strengths 
and protect each other from the lurking dangers.

As they approached the `zShadow Isle`X, they faced the true horrors of `RMorwen's`X 
necromancy. Undead creatures lurked in the shadows, and the corruption was 
spreading like a blight, choking the life from the once-vibrant land.

`GLyra`X and her companions faced countless trials and hardships, but their 
determination never wavered. The fellowship's bond grew stronger as they shared 
laughter, sorrow, and victories. Each of them knew that their united purpose 
was more significant than any individual glory.

As they approached the heart of the `zShadow Isle`X, `RMorwen`X sensed their presence 
and unleashed his darkest forces upon them. The final battle was fierce and 
relentless. The necromancer wielded the power of the souls he had captured, 
seeking to drown the world in everlasting darkness.

But the fellowship had a weapon far stronger than `RMorwen's`X dark magicâ€”their 
unity and unwavering resolve. Together, they faced the necromancer and shattered 
his vile spells, drawing upon their strengths and the hope that they carried 
within.

In the end, the fellowship prevailed, and `RMorwen's`X corruption was pushed back, 
weakening the grip of the `zShadow Isle`X on the ocean and the main continent. 
However, they knew the evil had only been held at bay, not defeated entirely. 
Their victory was a temporary respite, and the world would still need champions 
to rise and face the darkness whenever it dared to resurface.

The tale of the fellowship's heroic deeds echoed throughout the land, inspiring 
others to be vigilant and ready to fight against the ever-looming shadow of the 
`zShadow Isle`X. And so, the world held its breath, knowing that one day, when 
darkness threatened to engulf it again, a new band of heroes would arise to 
stand against it and safeguard their realm.

corruption.

`YTormund Foeaxe`X - A dwarven fighter of some renown, the first non-elf to off aid to `GLyra`X

`OThislefoot`X - A halfling rogue, joining them even though there was thought to be no riches
on the `zShadow Isle`X, purely due to his good nature and desire to protect the lands from
the coming darkness.

    DWARFS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`X

      Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper
      and great stamina.  Dwarves are strong and have the ability
      to heal exceptionaly well, however their body structure doesn't
      allow them to be very flexible with their movements.  They are
      not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long
      lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and mystics, and are
      also skilled in the art of alchemy.

      Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease, but cannot swim,
      and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  They even have the
      ability to see in the dark.

`C    ELVES
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
      Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter
      build.  They lack the strength and stamina of the other races, 
      but are far more agile, both in body and mind.  Elves are superb
      mages and rogues, but have at best fair talent as soldiers, 
      hunters, or mystics.  Others have shown great skill as alchemists
      and elementalists.
`W
      Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical
      nature.  However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are
      barred from the use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.
      Elves are notoriously hard to spot, and so elven rogues tend to 
      have the natural ablitity to sneak around.  They also have the 
      ability to see in the dark.

    HUMANS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`X

The most common race they are of average height and weight, and as 
individuals they can be quite intelligent,

Most of the heroes, wizards, nobles and people worth any note at all are human. 
This is probably because, as already has been stated, humans are the most common 
race, so if heroes, wizards etc are picked by fate at random, the odds on bet is 
that charactera worthy of note will be human.

`W
    The skill system allows players to customize their characters, making
    them skilled in what they choose.  Skills are paid for with creation 
    points (cp).  The more creation points acquired the more experience it
    takes for a player to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-costing skills
    are generally harder to practice and master.   
`W
    Groups are a package deal that consists of skills or spells that are 
    closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  A default skill 
    group is available for each class.
`W
    In summary, there isn't a golden creation point number.  Each player will
    need to decide how skilled they want their characters to be.  As a general
    rule, the more creation points a character has, the higher the experience
    points are before the character can gain a level.

0 Seraphim MAGE~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    MAGE
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Mages are those that have studied the ways in which the forces of 
    nature can be bent to an individuals will. Unlike elementalists, 
    who give themselves over to the power of the elements, the mage 
    focuses his will until the elements perform feats that are entirely 
    unnatural. Fireballs, lightning out of a clear sky, ice forming on 
    the hottest of days, these are some of the less exotic castings that 
    the mage is capable of performing. Mages, for the most part, eschew 
    wearing bulky armor. They prefer ornate robes that proclaim their 
    status to the world in order to propagate awe and sometimes fear. For 
    all races of E'dhora know that it was the modern mage's predecessors
    that caused the Cataclysm. So it is with at least some distrust that 
    the mage is met with wherever they go in pursuit of magical knowledge.

`W
    None can deny the skill and ability of the mage.  This class has the skill
    to tap into the very energies that flow around us and manifest it to their 
    will.  Only a mage has the ability to use the illusion and transportation 
    spell group.  
`W
    All mages begin with skill in using a staff.  However, mages tend to advance
    better by using magic as compared to weapons.  The default skills for mages

-1 Seraphim CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Clerics are the most defensively orientated class.  Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with
their few combat spells being less powerful than those of mages.
However, clerics are the best class by far at healing, & they
posess an impressive area of protective magics, as well as
fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in mace.  Other weapon skills must
be purchased, many at a dear cost.  The default skill selection
for clerics is as follows:

`Rskills:`X
flail		the proper use of flails

`Rspell groups:`X
attack		a selection of offensive magics
creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative	spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
benedictions	powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
healing		spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
maladictions	an assortment of curses
protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
transportation	spells for getting from here to there

`C    ROGUE
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Rogues are those who are abandoned by society, or perhaps those 
    that merely seek to live off the work of others, that make their 
    living by stealing whatever they can. Gifted with quick hands, a 
    startling degree of agility, and razor-sharp wits, the successful 
    rogue is the undisputed master of the streets. It is said that master 
    rogues can render themselves nearly invisible in broad daylight thanks 
    to the stealth techniques that have developed among the various factions 
    that have arisen in the centuries since the Cataclysm. Spotting a rogue 
    is very hard, simply for the fact that hiding their nature is a necessity
    if they are to stay in business. So an adventuring rogue may outfit 
    himself like a fighter, a hunter, or any number of professions, in 
    order to better insinuate himself into a group into an adventuring 
    group in order to make himself rich.
`W
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
-1 Seraphim 'ROGUE BASICS' 'ROGUE DEFAULT'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Rogues do few things better than any other class, but they have
have the widest range of skills available.  Rogues are
specialists at thievery & covert actions, being capable of
entering areas undetected where more powerful adventurers would
fear to tread.  They are better fighters than clerics, but lack
the wide weapon selection of fighters.

All rogues begin with the dagger skill, and are learned in steal
as well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the
default is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

`Rskills:`X
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing
backstab	the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm		used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack	with training, the skilled rogue can hit twice as fast
trip		a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide		the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek		used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a rogue can walk into a room undetected

    What good is a shield if it is not employed properly.  The art
    of blocking blows with a shield is but another form of parrying.  
    However one must parry with a weapon and block with a shield. 
    This martial art is just that, and one that cannot be mastered 
    while dealing with bags of components, baggy sleeves, and other 
    bits of collected matter that those who live, and sometimes die, 
    by the power of their spells.

    Harmful spells are designed to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, 
    and generally turn the body against itself.  Casters who are well 
    practiced in the art of harmful spells have even been known to make

`W
    Syntax: `Gbackstab <victim>
`W    Syntax: `Gbs <victim>
`W        
    A knife between the shoulder blades is usually a huge detriment
    to doing much of anything.  Rogues and rogues employ this
    rather, effective tactic in combat.  One problem found in using 
    a weapon is the fact that a knife has a great chance of lodging 
    in the victim's back or dulling the weapon to the point where it 
    is not as useful in normal fighting.  Backstabbing is a risky 
    attack, and is best done when the assailant comes from the 
    shadows, because of the many things which entail the success of a
    backstab, there is a large chance of failure.  Only the smallest
    of blades can be effectively used for backstabbing.

`C    BASH
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gbash <target>
`W
    Flinging the weight of your body at someone else is a fairly 
    simple brute force attack which involves simply that, literally
    hurling your body at someone else in the hope that you will 
    knock them down.  Success in this is not only based on the skill
    of the attacker, but also greatly on the size of both the attacker 
    and the victim of the bash.  Bashing someone not only has the 
    effect of knocking someone down, but at times it can delay or
    completely disrupt the casting of a spell from a magician or 
    mystic.

-1 Seraphim BERSERK~

`C    BERSERK
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gberserk
`W
    Rage is a powerful force, uncontrolled it can be destructive to
    all who are nearby.  When controlled, rage can be channeled raw
    power over a short time against an opponent.  Those trained in 
    this art of berserking can use their rage to overpower an enemy.  
    Disregard to personal safety and for the most part the safety of 
    others, is common to those who are berserking, but those who have
    felt the pure rush of power when in this rage have little concern
    of other things.  It is also said that dwarves have the ability 
    to utilize the berserk skill.

-1 Seraphim DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    DIRT KICKING
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gdirt <victim>
`W
    Considered by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the 
    clever combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt 
    into his eyes.  The blindness does not last long, but can provide
    an edge in combat.  Dexterity helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt
    kick.

`C    DISARM
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gdisarm
`W
    Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to 
    relieve your opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of
    disarming occurs when you are skilled both your own and your 
    opponent's weapon.

~
-1 Seraphim DODGE~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    DODGE
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
`W
    The best way to avoid being hurt is to not get hit.  The art of  
    dodging blows is important to any adventurer.  Though it is not 
    perfect and will not make one invincible it may well be what gets 
    a person through a melee with their life.
`W
    The chance of dodging is affected by the dexterity of the attacker
    and the dexterity of the target.
`W
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
-1 Seraphim 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Fighters & skilled rogues can become skilled in combat to a
point that they're able to inflict more damage than others.
Enhanced damage is checked for with each hit, although with a
low skill, the chance of recieving a bonus is very low indeed.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim ENVENOM~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
This skill is a cowardly skill practiced by rogues, designed to
win a battle through alchemy & treachery.  Or, put another way,
it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.  Food, drink
or weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects.  Poisoned
food/drink puts a mild poison on the consumer, unlikely to be
more than a minor inconvenience.  A poisoned weapon, however,
can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison burns
through their blood.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates
quickly & is rendered almost powerless by repeated combat blows.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'HAND TO HAND'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill.  Learning this style of
fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed- bare
hands.  Trained experts in this are more effective than any
swordsman.  All can learn this, but clerics & fighters are best.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim KICK~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
This allows the attacker to recieve an extra attack in combat,
a powerful kick.  However, a failed kick may throw an unwary
fighter off balance.  Fighters & clerics are the most skilled
at kicking, although rogues may also learn it.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim PARRY~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
If at first you fail to dodge, then parry!  This is useful for
deflecting attacks, & is successful more than dodge.  It
requires a weapon for full success.  The best chance of success
occurs when the defender is skilled in both his & his foe's
weapon.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim RESCUE~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    RESCUE
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Grescue <character>`W
`W
    A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a fighter
    with the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows 
    you to intercede in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily
    harm. Hopefully the favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing 
    depends on the skill rating, as well as a comparision of level,
    dexterity, and speed between the character and the target.  Once
    the rescue is successful the opponent is now fighting you instead of 
    whomever you've rescused.
`W
`R    Note: `OSee also - `Gflee

~
-1 Seraphim TRIP~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Trip is a dastardly attack, & involves using any one of a number
of methods to bring your foe down to the ground.  Tripping large
monsters is generally not a good idea, & agile ones will find
the attack easy to avoid.  Rogues & fighters may learn it.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'SECOND ATTACK'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Training in this skill allows you a chance at additional strikes
in combat- note that a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee
2 attacks every round.  Any class may learn this skill, although
clerics & mages have a very hard time with it.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'THIRD ATTACK'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Training in this skill allows you a chance at an additional
strike in combat, and increases the chance of a second attack
as well.  Note that 100% third attack does NOT assure 3 attacks
every round.  Only fighters & rogues may learn this skill.

`C    SNEAK    
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gsneak
`W
    The greatest enemy of the rogue is a dry twig, a shimmer of light
    reflecting off their armor as they attempt to bypass some guards.
    Sneaking is the ability to move from place to place unseen, and
    definately unheard.  Those that master this skill are truly ones
    to fear.
`W
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
-1 Seraphim 'FAST HEALING'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
This improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting
or sleeping.  It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just
general toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every
tick, & it is possible for it to fail.  All classes may learn
this, but mages find it difficult to master.

`W
    Syntax: `Glore <object>
`W
    Lore is a general skill that may be obtained by certain classes within
    the realm.   It consists of the caster combining their knowledge of myths
    and legends, into a spell in order to obtain information on an object 
    concerning its power and uses.
`W
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
-1 Seraphim HAGGLE HAGGLING~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Haggling is the trader's skill, allowing a character to match
wits with merchants; recieving better prices when selling items,
or buying at the lowest possible cost.  Most merchants are
very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best
guard his treasure closely.  Rogues are natural masters at
haggling, but other classes can learn it as well.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim PEEK~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
This skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is
carrying, the better to use the steal command with.  More
intelligent characters are harder to peek at.  All characters
may learn peek, but rogues are the most common practitioners.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of rogues, allowing
them to gain access to secured areas.  Success chances are
improved by intelligence & hindered by the difficulty of the
lock.  Other classes may learn to pick locks, but never well.

`W
    Syntax: `Gsteal <object> <victim>
`W
    Since the beginning of time when caves were the dwelling of choice, 
    and people began collecting belongings, there have been others who 
    have of course, wanted what does not belong to them.  Over this 
    enormous span of time, certain aspects of the profession have been 
    refined.  Stealing is an art of sorts, those that are good at it are
    well paid, just like artists, but those who are inept are either dead,
    homeless, or incarcerated.  Anything that is carried is fair game for 
    a rogue, only those possessions kept close to the body, or worn are 
    truly safe, and if a rogue truly wants something, even those items are
    not completely safe from being taken. A rogue should always use caution
    because society has a way to label those who attempt to steal and are 
    caught.

dark magic at their peril.

-1 Seraphim 'RECHARGE'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>`X

This spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands & staves.

Magic items can only be recharged one time successfully.

    of the caster.

~
-1 Seraphim 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>`X

This spell opens a portal to the planes of positive energy,
bringing forth a beam of light which harms or annihilates
the servants of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, &
will turn & strike casters who are tainted by evil.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X 
~
-1 Seraphim 'PORTAL'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>`X

This spell is similar to gate but creates a lasting 1-way portal
to the target creature rather than just transporting the caster.
Portals are entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in
'go portal'.  They cannot be made to all places, nor used to
escape from gate-proof rooms.  This spell requires a special
source of power to be used, but the secret of this material
component has been lost to time...
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'NEXUS'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>`X

This spell is nearly identical to portal, except that it makes
a 2-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require a power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'HEAT METAL'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>`X

This is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that
vary according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up metal
EQ on the target, causing him or her to drop them if possible,
taking serious burns in the process.  This spell does no
damage to creatures who are immune to fire.

Please note: at this time this spell assumes all weapon/armor
are made of metal, but this will be changing.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X

-1 Seraphim 'HOLY WORD'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'holy word'`X

Holy word involved the invoking of the power of a cleric's god
with disastrous effects upon the foes of the cleric coupled with
powerful blessings on the cleric's allies.  All creatures of
like alignment in the room are blessed & filled with righteous
divine wrath, while those of opposite morals (or both good &
evil in the case of neutral clerics) are struck down by holy
might and cursed.  The cleric suffers greatly from the strain
of this spell, being left unable to move & drained.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim FRENZY~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>`X

This spell fills the target with fury, greatly increasing their
attack skill.  It is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats
to personal safety, making the character easier to hit.  It
provides immunity to the calm spell, & may only be used on those
of the caster's alignment.

    Syntax: `Gcast 'calm'
`W
    Mystics over time have found that truly the best way to heal a
    wound is to stop it from happening in the first place, and thus
    the calm spell.  Working over a small area, this spell not only
    stops fighting between combatants, but also leaves a small
    residual weakness upon those in the area as a reminder not to
    fight.  Calm is a quite useful, and for the most part, an
    overlooked incantation.

`RSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>`X

This spell increases the speed & agility of the target, allowing
an extra attack in combat & improving evasive ability in combat.
However, it produces a great strain on the system, such that
recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim SLOW~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>`X

Slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell with its own
unique set of effects.  When cast on a victim, it slows its
movements (making it easier to hit & reducing rate of attack).
Movement costs are doubled on the victim & healing rates halved.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim PLAGUE~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>`X

This spell infests the target with a magical disease of great
virulence, sapping its strength & causing horrific suffering,
possibly leading to death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the
contagion can spread like wildfire if the victim makes it to
a populated area.

0 Seraphim 'CREATE ROSE'~

`C    CREATE ROSE    
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'create rose'
`W
    Magic is most often used for offense and defense. However there are
    times when romance can be a powerful tool.  Some spell casters have 
    learned to create a fragrant red rose for those times when a romantic 
    spell is required.

~
-1 Seraphim 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>`X
`R        cast 'protection good' <target>`X

These spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the
appropriate ethos, & improve saving throws against all forms of
magic.  They may not be cast on others, & 1 person cannot carry
both defenses at the same time on them.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
0 Seraphim 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>`X
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.

0 Seraphim 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    CHAIN LIGHTNING    
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'chain lightnig' <target>
`W
    The ability to control lightning, the very rage of the world, is
    nearly impossible, and that fact is shown with this immensely
    powerful spell.  Countless mages have died as a result of the
    attempt to wield the chaotic force of lighting.  The effect of the
    lightning in this spell, is a charged bolt that literally bounces
    from victim to victim (which can, and usually does, include the
    caster) until it runs out of strength.  Many caster's cannot
    withstand the effect of their own invocation.

`C    FARSIGHT                           
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `G cast 'farsight' <victim>
`W
    The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing them 
    to see their victim like they were in the same room.  It takes intense 
    concentration and control to locate the person.  If that person is of 
    higher ranking than the caster it is often more difficult to find them.  
`W
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
-1 Seraphim MASS HEALING~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'mass healing'`X

This spell, as its name suggests, performs a healing spell on
all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell
for good measure.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim 'FLOATING DISC'~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'floating disc'`X

This spell creates a floating field of force which follows the
caster around, allowing them to pile things high with no fear
of weight penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters
level in hours, and usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per
level of the caster, with a maximum of 5 pounds per item.  The
spell requires an open float location, & the only way to remove
the disc is to die or allow it to run out of energy.
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
~
-1 Seraphim FIREPROOF~
`Y----------------------------------------------------------------`X
`RSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>`X

This spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an
object to shield it from the effects of acid or fire.  Items
protected by this spell are immune to heat metal.  Although not
expensive to use, it's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.

`W
    Syntax: `Galias`W
    Syntax: `Galias <word>`W
    Syntax: `Galais <word> <subsitution>`W
    Syntax: `Gunalias <word>
`W
    This command allows limited shortening of command names.  At
    this time, aliases cannot call other aliases, and can't generate
    more than one command.
`W
    Alias by itself lists your current aliases.
    Alias <word> lists the alias with that word if it exists.    
    Alias <word> <substitution> produces a new alias.  
    You cannot alias the words 'alias' or 'unalias'.
`W
    Examples of use:
`W    
    alias gc get all corpse
       typing 'gc' will equal typing 'get all corpse'
`W    
    alias ff cast 'fireball'
       typing 'ff orc' will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'
`W
    Only the first word on the line will be substituted at this time.

`C    THE COINAGE AND CURRENCY OF MARS
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W   
    If the lands of MARS are the flesh, then money is the
    life-blood that keeps it functioning.  From the simplest trades
    including simple trading of goods, to the usage of coins and paper money.  
`W
    The vast majority of most coins are of copper and silver.
`W
                 10 Copper Pieces (Pieces) = 1 Copper coin
                 10 Copper Coins (Copper) = 1 Silver Coin
                 10 Silver Coins (Silver) = 1 Gold Coin

                 Copper Pieces are abbbreviated as Pieces or P 
                 Copper Coins are abbreviated as `OCopper `Xor `OC`X

`C    THE BRIEF & COMPACT COMMANDS
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gbrief`W
    Syntax: `Gcompact    
`W
    To assist you in navigating the vagarities of Discworld you may 
    choose a display mode, brief or compact. Typing brief toggles on
    and off the showing of room descriptions when you move  around 
    (considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
    removes the extra blank line before your prompt.

`C    DEAF
`c------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`W
      Deaf is a toggle that turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are 
      being bombarded by messages from other players.  You can still use        
      reply to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, 
      although you cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are 
      a diety (it's mostly useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed 
      so I went deaf" message to a person).

-1 Seraphim AFK~

`C    AFK & LINKDEAD
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
      AFK stands for, "away from keyboard".  It is a command that allows
      you to leave your computer screen for a short time.  Any incoming
      private tells are stored in a special buffer that can be accessed
      when you return by typing, "replay".   AFK shows in your prompt
      until it is turned off.  
`W
      A similiar buffer is opened when a player goes "linkdead", which is
      when their connection is suddenly lost for a variety of reasons.
      Upon that characters return to the game, lost tells can be recovered
      also, by typing, "replay".
`W
`R      NOTE:   `YGoing AFK will not offer the player any special protection
              from PKilling, poison or disease, and/or mob attacks.

-1 Seraphim EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    EXPERIENCE AND LEVELS
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need
    a set amount of experience points for each level based on your
    creation points.
`W
    You gain experience by:
`W
        defeating a monster or player in battle
        being part of a group that kills a monster or player
        being awarded during a quest of some sort
        getting better at a skill or spell
`W
    You lose experience by:
`W
        fleeing from combat
        recalling out of combat
        dying
`W
    The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:
`W           
        how many players are in your group; your level versus the
        level of the monster; your alignment versus the monster's
        alignment; and some random variation.

`W
`W      Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
`W      combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration,
`W      spell duration, weather, and area resetting.
`W
`W      Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly
`W      called the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real
`W      time, but the actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45
`W      seconds.
`W
`W      Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the
`W      area; less often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects

-1 Seraphim CAST CASTING~
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    CASTING
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
      Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you
      practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.
      Casting spells costs mana.  The mana cost decreases as your level
      increases.
`W
      The target is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use
      an appropriate default target, especially during combat.
`W
      If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the
      spell name.  Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is
      optional for single-word spells.  You can abbreviate the spell name.
`W
      When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving
      throw.  The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the
      victim makes the saving throw successfully.

    fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another
    character can RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL if your level is ten
    or less, but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience 
    points then fleeing).
`W
    If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
    fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
    of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more

    it sparingly.  
`W
    Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.
`W
    QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
    you will be back in the same room.
`W

`W
    TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
    character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
    initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
    using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).
`W
    It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
    mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.
`W
    The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
    practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.

`W
    TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is
    similar to advancing the character for accessing immortal commands,
    but has no effect on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more
    trust to mortal (or immortal) characters to give them access to more
    power without messing up the character.  You can also restrict a
    player's trust to less than their natural level.
`W
    A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

`W
    A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players
    (set by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument
    after the site.  * may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu),
    prefix (labmac*), or content (*andrews*), but be careful not to

`W
    Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people 
    outside the room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are 
    with you.  It takes a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at 
    that level or higher can see you regarless of location.
`W
    WIZINVIS takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players 
    of a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
    (your level) if no argument is given.  For example, a wizi 60 character is
    totally invisible to players level 59 and less.  If you're wizi then typing
    wizi by itself turns it off again.
`W
    INVIS is a synonym for wizinvis.  It works the same as wizinvis and toggles

`W
    Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
    commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
`W
    LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does
    not persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

    magic.  Armor is the weakest of these spells, learned by nearly 
    every apprentice or dabbler in magic.  Even though weak, the armor
    spell is the key to learning the much more powerful abjurations,

    target.  Blessings are quite powerful, and not to be taken lightly.
    The strength of a blessing is more than sufficient to halt the
    casting of many other dangerous spells from opponents.
`W
    Cavaliers and Valkyries also have the ability to bless as they

    never be brought under the control of anyone, but the Elementalists
    have a minimal power over it with this spell, but the only control
    being the immediate area where the bolts touch the ground, and 
    little else.  Many an Elementalist attempting to harness the raw

    someone, be they friend or foe, that you are the greatest thing

    The necromancer is directly linked to darkness and the stark, utter
    cold of death and undeath.  With this spell a necromancer literally
    channels that unnatural cold of undeath into the palm of his hand
    and transfers it into his target.  While not particularly a spell
    of mass damage, its subtle side-effect saps the strength out of the
    victim.  That effect is not long lasting, but quite a difference

    Most spellcasters, even the lowest level apprentice, learn this
    spell, for it is one of the easiest spells found.  This spell
    harnesses a very small amount of magic and holds it in one place
    in the form of a tiny ball of light.  Once the creation of the ball
    is mastered (which is not an overly difficult task) this spell can
    also be used to illuminate objects with the same magical light.  An
    odd side effect of this spell seems to be the untimely death of many
    an apprentice who found the need to cast it upon nearly everything
    that they owned, which turned them into a well-lit beacon for thugs,
    murderers, and cutpurses.

`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>
`W
    Anyone who swings a sword, mace, or any other weapon, no
    matter their skill nor training, most likely wishes that
    their weapon of choice was able to do more damage, or swing
    faster, or be a little bit lighter.  This spell can enhance
    the characteristics of a weapon allowing those who live
    (and sometimes die) with their weapons to have something a
    little bit better than normal.  This spell can be cast upon
    a weapon more than once, but there is always a chance to
    destroy not only the weapon, but also the caster as well.

`C    ENCHANT ARMOR    
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'enchant armor' <armor>
`W
    Most every person who wears armor and relies on it to keep him or
    her safe and alive wishes that the armor could be a little bit 
    tougher, or a little bit stronger.  This spell does fit that bill
    to a point.  Mages or alchemists who wish to enchant a piece of 
    armor must make sure that it is composed of a material which can 
    hold the force of the energy, and then and only then they may attempt
    to enchant the piece of armor.  The magical enchantment added to the
    armor gives a small additional bonus of protection to the wearer. 
    Those who are brave enough to attempt it can try to cast additional 
    enchantments upon a piece of armor, but there is always a chance of
    the destruction of the armor, and severe damage to the caster.

`C    ENERGY DRAIN 
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'energy drain' <victim>
`W
      All things in existance are filled with some sort of energy, the
      energy that allows it to be perceived by other beings.  This
      energy serves as the target of this extremely potent spell.  The
      necromancer, when running low on his own resources taps into the
      energy of some creature or person and literally syphons this to
      himself.  The result is the obvious weakening of the victim and
      the improvement of the necromancer's stores.

`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'faerie fire' <target>
`W
    Being surrounded by the pink flames of this spell causes no
    damage to the afflicted, but instead the flames outline the
    victim making it much easier to strike that person with a
    physical weapon.  This spell is learned by elementalist early
    in their training, and while it is a rather innoculous and
    harmless spell then, the fire of a well trained elementalist 
    has been known to help in bringing down even the mightiest of 
    foes.

`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'faerie fog'
`W
    It was once said that mystical faeries had exceptional sight, and 
    very little could escape their diminutive glance.  In the early 
    years, elementalist learned of this myth, and conjured a spell named 
    after the mystical faeries.  The spell does not grant the caster 
    the vision of the faeries, but instead makes those who are not 
    normally visible by normal sight visible for a short period of 
    time.  This effect is by no means permanent,  but it does linger 
    in the air for a short duration.

`W
`W    Syntax: `Gcast 'identify' <object> 
`W
`W    Magic is an oddity to most, and seen as something to be feared by   
`W    others.  In reality, magic is quite structured and easy to disect
`W    into parts which can be looked at in pieces much easier than as a
`W    whole.  Items which hold some sort of magical disposition are exactly
`W    the same.  Spells such as identify allow someone to learn a little
`W    more about an object, not entirely everything about it, but enough
`W    to know the basics of how to make it work, and how to unleash the

`W
    It is known that certain gods favor magic and proves such by bestowing
    special objects with the ability to cast the word of recall spell.  
    These items are rare and special gifts left behind by the gods and magic
    users of the past.  Should you be lucky enough to find one, treasure its 
    abilities and do not waste them.  
`W
    If a traveler attempts to use a recall object during combat it is not 
    guaranteed to be successful and if it is, experience will be lost. A 
    successful recall will also cost half of the traveler's movement points.

We are not open for players just yet but we are working very hard to
bring this wonderful game to realization.  For those of you that came by
before and checked us out, you will notice some severe changes, but all 
for the positive movement of the game.  MARS will be a very PvE/Party 
intensive game and our players will reflect that.  Feel free to check back 
from time to time to see if we are open.
`c
For those of you that wish to help in our development, we are looking
for builders and coders that have moderate to heavy experience and can
build in our atmosphere.  While you are here take a moment to read the
`RHELP MARS`c to get a feel of what we are trying to accomplish.  
Maps of our world are also available for viewing. See help link for details. 
Leave Praesius a note or email (mars@wr3tch.org) and he will set up a 
time to talk to you about joining our team.
`W 
On behalf of the staff, thank you for coming.

-1 Seraphim PKILLING PKILLER PK PLAYER KILLING PLAYER_KILLING PSTEALING~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    PK PLAYER_KILLING         
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Player killing or PK is attacking and killing another player's character. 
`W
    1. Player Killing MUST be role played appropriately. It isnt acceptable 
       to just wander up to someone and slay them for no apparent reason.  
       DO NOT PK someone simply because your character is evil or insane, 
       or because the have an item you want. All Pks must have a good role-play 
       reason to occur. The individual characters personality, NOT the typists 
       personal like or dislike of another character, should drive PK. 
`W
    2. The PK victim must not be more than 8 levels below the attacker.  There 
       is no upper limit as long as the attacker is lower than the victim.
`W
    3. Multiple Player Kills will not be tolerated. This means killing numerous 
       players or the same player in a short amount of time. With the exception 
       of war or other such rare retaliation incidents should allow an 
       acceptable time frame (approximately an hour) between kills. If you have 
       PKed someone, and they come back and attack or give good solid reason to 
       be killed again, then they have annulled their right. 
`W
    4. Player Killing new players, those under level 11, will not be tolerated. 
       If you are having problems with a new player, contact an immortal before 
       resorting to Player Killing. 
`W
    5. Retaliating against someone who killed your character using a stronger 
       character is forbidden. Your stronger character has no role-play reason 
       for revenge. 
`W
    6. Logging out after stealing equipment from players, whether directly or 
       indirectly, or after attacking or killing another player is considered 
       illegal. Players should develop a Role Play out of situations resulting 
       from PK, to block these good intentions could result in penalties from 
       the gods. 
`W
    7. A game time minimum of 10 minutes real time is required before logging 
       your character out after a PK attack. 
`W
`W
    PKers also should pick carefully the locations of their attacks. Some 
    Kingdoms have strict laws associated with murders. Crimes will be proven 
    and penalties carried out. Be aware that your characters actions will 
    have costs associated if you're found guilty or if a King demands that 
    you be punished. 
`W
    Violation of the rules and guidelines will result in stiff penalties 
    including character deletion, denial, and even site banning if 
    necessary. If you are a victim of non role-played PK notify the gods 
    via personal note. Include all facts surrounding the attack and the 
    persons on both sides involved.

-1 Seraphim RULES~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    RULES: AS CLEAR AS THEY CAN BE. 
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    As with all things, whether for business or pleasure, rules have to be 
    set in place to maximize the efficiency and enjoyability of the activity 
    at hand. In the effort of protecting the fun of everyone, these rules have 
    been written to maintain the continuity of the project and the longevity of 
    the game. To break them is to risk being removed from the game. 
`W
    1. Before anything else is said, realize that playing here is a privilege, 
       and not a right. While we appreciate the time you spend with us, this 
       is not to say we will not exist without you. 
`W
    2. MARS is a ROLEPLAY ENFORCED MUD. You are expected 
       to be in character at all times. There are OOC platforms set aside for 
       players that require assistance. 
`W
    3. Do not kill steal. This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
       fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs. 
`W
    4. Do not sit around idle for extended amounts of time. Since MARS is 
       a roleplay mud, a rogue may take an idle character for a victim and 
       rob them blind. 
`W
    5. Multi-playing is not allowed in any form. Those caught doing this will 
       be removed, usually immediately. Those people claiming to share their 
       connection with another will be tested.  
`W
`O       See also `G'Help Multiplaying'`W. 
`W
    6. Player Killing MUST be role played appropriately. Since PK tends to 
       be complex be sure to review and understand the PK Rules. 
`W
`O       See also `G'Help PK Rules'`W. 
`W
    7. Profanity and other lewd comments are not allowed on public channels. 
       We may have some younger children playing our game and cannot 
       allow such language and remarks openly. Note below: 
`W
       a. public channels are any communicative form that can reach more 
          that one person simultaneously. ie: gossip, yell, shout. 
       b. public channels are for IC communication only. 
       c. do not spam the public channels. 
`W
    8. To reveal the alternate characters of a player "alts" openly is very 
       much frowned upon. Such information should be kept to oneself. If 
       found revealing such information publicly, you will be dealt with. 
`W
    9. Character names are to remain original and should not reflect some 
       already preset fantasy realm. Examples of this would be, "Elminster", 
       "Merlin", "Charlemange", etc. Please help us keep this world original. 
`W
    10. Cheating will not be tolerated. This includes exploiting bugs. If you 
        find a bug, report it, then do not use it. 
`W
    11. Characters that have been deleted, either by staff, or yourself, will 
        not be restored. Whatever the reason that caused the action will be 
        respected and held firm. 
`W
    12. The staff, admin and those people that strive to make MARS a 
        place we can all enjoy are to be respected. Insults, harrassment or 
        blatant disrespect will not be tolerated. Failure to perform the 
        request of an staff member is also not tolerated. 
`W
    Note: Players are expected to report any concern they have over an immortal
    breaking rules.  Such reports will be investigated by the admin and if the 
    staff member is found breaking the rules, they will be removed immediately
    or receive punishment as determined to suited for the wrong doing.  
`W
    Our rules are subject to be altered at any time we deem fit. As times and 
    events change, so do the rules. You, as a player, are expected to both 
    understand this, and respond appropriately to the change.

`W
    Syntax: `Gclan

    The clan system here, in MARS is both simple and complex at the same
    time.  Each of the seven kingdoms has a code supported clan or house.  The
    kingdom has a clan hall with a house leader selected from the player base 
    and appointed by the imps.  The house leader has the ability to induct and 
    outcast house members. The hall will start with a set number of rooms 
    based on their status in the realm and the house has the ability to expand
    their holdings.  Each house starts with a chest for equipment, a clanbank,
    and a private channel to speak to their house members. Each kingdoms 
    structure will be set up based on their history.   
`W
    Individual players may also start and found a clan or order, providing 
    they meet certain requirements before hand.  Player clans may be located
    in any kingdom with the permission of the owner of that land, aka the 
    house leader of the kingdom.  The player based clans will not be supported
    by code however the group may purchase rooms and design their set up as 
    they would a private house.  All agreements between kingdom leaders and 
    player house leaders will be made in writing to assure agreement between 
    all parties are understood by both the parties and the gods.

    Words of wisdom from some unknown author:
`W
    Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
    All checksummed were the compressed files
    And the man pages, outdated
    Beware the Internet my son,
    The noise that hangs, the lag that kills
    Beware the Usenet news, and shun the frivolous mud with frills
    So took his his mudding client in hand
    Longtime the virtual foe he sought
    So rested he by the T1s three and paused a while in swap
    And as in disk-drive swap he stayed,
    The Internet, with lags of fame
    Came packetwise through the T1 line
    And error-checked as it came
    One two one two and through and through, the mudding client went kill -9
    He left it dead and with it's core he went a tracing back
    And hath thou slain the Internet?
    Come to my arms my disk-based bot!
    Oh lag-free day, callooh callay, he chortled in his joy
    Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
    All checksummed were the compressed files
    And the man pages, outdated.

 The above commands are used to expand the game world.  The original code it
is based on was written by Surreality and installed in The Isles by Locke. 
It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
by Hans Birkeland (Hugin).  It has been heavily modified and extended by
MacGregor/Nibios.

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room, and EDIT AREA RESET resets the current area.  Most
commands with no arguments display syntax.

`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Gdual' <weapon>
`W
    While two wrongs do not make a right, and sometimes two heads 
    really are better than one, two weapons in most instances are 
    more useful to the person holding them than one is, that is if
    they know just exactly what they are doing.  While not all weapons 
    can be used together, there are many combinations which are quite 
    useful.  Most choices involve two smallish blades; stilettos, daggers,
    dirks, and even short swords.  While rogues are the true masters of 
    using two weapons, soldier and hunters can also learn this 
    technique, and at times can use larger weapons in combination than
    rogues can, due to sheer strength.  
`W
    Remove is used to remove this weapon and return it back into 
    your inventory.

`W
`W    Syntax:  `Gglance <target>
`W
    A passing glance is often done by anyone as they walk along in 
    the realm however over time rogues have learned how to really 
    dig in and glance deeper into a person's pockets.  If performed 
    successfully, the player will not know they have even been looked

`W
    Syntax: `Ginvoke <object>
`W
    In the manner of BRANDISH, RECITE, or ZAP comes this command.  The catch
    here is that any object *might* be something that can be invoked, whether 
    it is a talisman made of herbs or a relic of a holy sword, and anything
    in between.
`W
    Once you know something can be invoked, to use it simply type 'INVOKE

`W
    Syntax: `Gpush <target>
            `Gpull <target>
`W
    The PUSH and PULL commands can be used on monsters or objects,
    depending on where you are.  The most common usage is on monsters, 
    in the attempt to move someone out of a current room and into 
    another.
`W 
    Sometimes you will stumble across buttons, ropes, pulleys, and
    even plants or other things that can be PULLed or PUSHed.

`W 
    To place a bid on an item currently up for auction, use the
    'BID <amount>'.  The highest bid wins the item.
`W
    'Look auction' allows a player interested in the auction item
    to view the details of the item.  Type, level, value, and 
    bid price is available. 
`W
    The player holding the auction can take the item off of
    auction if they change their mind by typing 'auction remove'.

    the fallen.  Working with materials on hand, namely a corpse, some
    salve, and a bit of bandaging he prepares the corpse to walk again.  
    Using the arcane knowledge allowed to them, a necrocmancer can 
    restore life to that corpse, for short periods of time.  Reanimated
    corpses do not, in any way, resemble their previous forms as the

Rules are not made to be bent, broken, or reinterpreted.
There are no loopholes in the rules.  They mean what they mean, and any
rationalizations to questionable actions by Immortals that could be
considered breaking the rules will only make matters worse.  If you're not
sure, then ask or don't do it.  

`R*`wYou are still required to follow all of the mortals' rules, those of
'help rules'.  

`R*`wDo not use 'reboot' or 'shutdown'.

`R*`wDo not make assumptions.

`R*`wBe respectful to other Imms and their personal space.  (ask permission
before entering a personal room) 

`R*`wKnow what you're typing.  Be especially careful with purge, slay, and
other potentially destructive commands.  

`R*`wDo not kill mortals!  Period.  Do not kill them with your own hands, and
do not kill them indirectly by transferring them into an aggressive mob.  

`R*`wDo not give mortals anything.  (any kind of quest or temple points,
hints, tips, tricks, information to exploit loopholes or bugs, enchant eq,
money, transfer them, corpse retrievals, eq) Mortals are here to depend on
each other for help.  We're not here to help them level.  

`R*`wDo not use the purge, slay or freeze command on mortals.

`R*`wDo not harrass mortals in any way.  By doing so, you might become one
quickly, and then you'll have enemies on a level playing field.  

`R*`wGrant no special favors to any player regardless of clan, temple, guild,
race, class, anything.  

`R*`wDo not ever cheat for your own mortal character.

`R*`wDo not relieve a mortal for a punishment you did not administer. 

`R*`wWrite notes to 518 and 520 for all punishments administered

1 Seraphim IMMPOLICY~
`R*`wFavoritism with players is very dangerous.  It is okay to have mortal
friends, but keep it discrete and/or private.  

`R*`wIt is understood that Imms are going to have more knowledge of area
layouts, where to find eq, where to get the best xp, this is okay - it
happens.  Being a mortal does not permit you to spread the knowledge you've
learned as an Immortal.  If you want to group with another mortal and show
him a secret xp area, then do so, but do not just tell the player exact
directions.  Have fun and play with the mortals, don't just give hand-outs. 

`R*`wDo not get too involved in mortal affairs.  It is very possible to get
caught up in a situation where one of the rules above may be broken.  For
your own security, keep some distance.  If you want to play (a mortal),
play.  

`R*`wKeep track of punishments you have administered.  Sentences may be
prolonged if punished players whine about their sentences (this holds true
if the player whines to another immortal).  

`R*`wWrite notes (report) to 518 and 520 about all punishments administered. 
Give a brief detail about the occurance that led to punishment, the type of
punishment administered, and the duration of the sentence.  
 
`R*`wDisputes among players or with fellow staff members should be resolved
quickly and without incident. We do our best to hire mature people as staff
members, please make an attempt to act accordingly.  If a conflict or
difference of opinion is genuine, ask a Supremacy or higher to be a
moderator.  Note: It is not this person's job to settle the dispute with a
one way ruling, but rather to suggest a compromise if possible.  Work things
out and do not overrule each other.  
 
`R*`wIf you're looking for a promotion or a reward, do not ask for one.  The
best option is to work smart and hard at your current responsibilities and
show a moderate interest (overeagerness can be annoying) in the new jobs in
which you would like to participate.  Creating quality work, participation
(idling for hours is not participation) and the ability to work well with
others are the best ways to earn a reward or promotion.  Efforts do not go
unnoticed.  
 
`R*`wFood For Thought:
Granted, Immortal toys, promotions, and rewards are nice, but one could
argue that the reward in Immortality comes from making a great atmosphere
for the players.  If for any reason, the work you put in here is no longer
rewarding for that reason, it may be time to take a break or rethink your
motivation for wanting to be an Immortal here at Artifice.  
 
`R*`wIf you have mud-related personal problems, please feel free to talk to
one of the Implementors.  We are mature adults and will not berate or laugh
at anybody for their problem.  If it is a problem with one of us, we can
handle it, let us know your beef.  This will not reflect on any brownie
points you've earned toward a reward or promotion.  We'd rather you approach
us and hopefully we can work together to solve the problem rather than have
it escalate into a more serious issue.

Visitor Seraphim IMMJOBS~
`R*`wImplementor`R*`w
The Implementors are the owners and primary administrators of Artifice. 
They are responsible for the status of the mud, the hiring of new staff
members, and the designers of large, in-game systems.  All ideas for new
implementations will be approved of by the Implementors before the idea is
converted into a real project.  Implementors are the final authority
regarding any disputes among players, staff members, or rule breakage.  
 
`R*`wCoder`R*`w
Coders, naturally, code the features of the mud.  They are also advisors.
Coders should be consulted about ideas for new features and implementations.
They must maintain the highest level of feasibility knowledge when comparing
proposed features and ideas to the current system.  When an idea or feature
is approved of by the Implementors, it is typically the coder's job to
figure out how a feature should be implemented based on the needs and
requirements of the new project.  
 
`R*`wSupremacy`R*`w
Supremacies are all-purpose Immortals.  They perform any and all of their
previous jobs (building, role playing, running quests), but this does not
mean they should pull rank and interfere with the ongoings of those
positions' primary staff members.  Being a Supremacy also brings other
responsibilities.  They are trusted as direct representatives and often
liaisons of the Implementors when the Imps are not available, therefore a
high calibur of trust is given to a person holding this position. 
Supremacies are granted high level disciplinary commands as well as other
powerful commands, however this does not entitle them to abuse or
over-active use of these commands.  Staff members who hold this position
have demonstrated their capability of restraint in using these powerful
commands, and will maintain that restraint.  
 
`R*`wBuilder`R*`w
A Builder's primary job is to build quality areas.  This means making
quality themes that are suitable for a proactively encouraged role playing
environment.  Game mechanics and statistical balance are imperative factors
when building.  Areasshould enhance the existing world rather than detract
from it.  Builders, as a rule, participate in role playing even if
indirectly.  The very world in which the players interact determines how
enthusiastic the players will be about role playing.  Builders are also
Quest Imms as well, as it is highly encouraged that quests be integrated
into areas from tiny "find a certain object" quests to more extensive, time
consuming puzzles.  
 
`R*`wQuest`R*`w
The Quest Immortals' primary job is to formulate quests for mortals to
play that are in the spirit of the role playing environment.  Quest
Immortals are advised to work with RP Imms for theme ideas or current events
in the role playing environment to run an appropriate quest.  It is also
recommended that Quest Immortals also participate in role playing where they
can.  
 
`R*`wRP`R*`w
An RP Immortal's primary job is to keep the spirit of role playing alive
within the game.  This can be done by role playing with the players or
publicly amongst themselves, writing short stories, helping players with
creative character development (assisting with writing descs, names,
surnames, etc), and helping Quest Imms develop spirited quest themes.  
 
`R*`wGeneral`R*`w
General Immortals are typically going to be promoted from within the
player-base.  General Immortals either do not have or have not decided on a
formal job as of yet.  Until that time, they may learn the ways of
Immortality by spending time and observing, or a higher level Immortal may
become their mentor.  A General Immortal must find a way to participate
constructively within the game by performing a job in order to get promoted
any further.  
 
`R*`wVisitor`R*`w
Immortals with the visitor status do not have formal jobs.  They are here
as friends or representatives from other muds.  They are not here to troll
players or staff members and if caught doing so will be dismissed.  Visitors
may ask questions, interview people for ideas, or observe behaviors of our
players and their interaction within the game.  Visitors must follow the
rules as listed under help immrules.

    `CTHE KINGDOMS OF FORSAKEN
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      `WWe have watched the reformation of the world since the cataclysm.
      Many dedicated scholars spent years writing their thoughts and views
      on what had come to pass.  From the ashes of a once vital world grew
      several powerful kingdoms.  Each with their own set of ideals and
      morals, each with their own goal for the world.  These kingdoms,
      perhaps by the will of the gods, are kept separated from one another
      by the writhing sea, those tempest storms that sweep its surface,
      and centuries of hatred.

      What seems to be the driving force behind these kingdoms are those
      ancient artifacts that all but destroyed our world.  Sources tell us
      that each kingdom holds within their boundaries one artifact, which
      would explain their rise to power.  If our sources are correct, then
      three artifacts are missing, perhaps that is why the kingdoms scan
      the globe, waging war and braving the sea.

      We have followed the progress of the seven kingdoms since the day of
      their instatement.  Recorded their highs and lows, their government
      and ideals.  We have done everything within our power to ensure
      accurate information on these powers have been passed on.  The names
      of these kingdoms are:

             `O-  `YCenalin, the Silver Empire
             `O-  `gthe Sullen Plains of Sorcia
             `O-  `Gthe Collected Lands of Estmina

`C    THE WORLD OF E'DHORA
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
      The world of E'dhora is one of magnificent contrasts and unexplained
      mystery.  A land  that has suffered much in the last millenium,
      victim of the activities of man and god, torn between the conflicting
      views of both groups.  The years before the cataclysm, after the gods
      had left man forsaken, were spent burning the natural resources of
      the world, damaging its ability to heal itself due to extreme magical
      experiments and activities.  Softly the world cried out, none could
      hear her.  When she could take no more, it is said by those now
      possessing the ability to commune with her, that she cried out in
      pain, the gods heard her and responded -- the cataclysm occurred.
 `W
      The cataclysm shook the face of E'dhora in ways mere words cannot
      accurately describe.  Lands that were once joined were torn asunder,
      sent sailing through boiling oceans to land elsewhere.  Entire sets
      of countries sank beneath the heated waves, while in other areas
      land rose from out of the sea to form entire new continents.  When
      all was calm and settled, five continents were left relatively intact, 
      hundreds of islands were scattered all about.  With the worst passed, 
      what life was left began to sprout once more, the magical residue 
      from the cataclysm began to change the world, shifting men into beasts 
      and vice versa.
 `W
      E'dhora is slowly recovering from the events of the past, what
      secrets she hides, what purpose the gods have for her lay sprinkled
      within the strands of fate.  What hero will rise to uncover these
      secrets?  To again rekindle the relationship between the gods and
      men?  Will the technologies of the past be rediscovered?  
 `W
      Who knows?  Do you...?

`C    THE ARTIFACTS OF E'DHORA
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `W     
      Long ago when the gods still looked down upon the world with kindness
      and favored those people that wandered the land, they bestowed unto
      those that lived there 10 artifacts that embodied their very being.
      Through the grace and power of these artifacts, men grew and evolved
      and learned.  Kingdoms spawned where before only small hovels and
      villages lay.  In time the gods came for their artifacts as man did
      not need their guidance any longer.  Greed and fear consumed man and
      they turned their back upon the gods, refusing to return the gifts
      the gods had bestowed upon them.  Instead of retribution, the gods
      simply declared the lands, Forsaken.
 
      After the cataclysm that transpired and shook the world on its very
      foundation, the artifacts were scattered about the world.  Seven
      were recovered, three remain missing.  Stories tell of men that
      have found an artifact and used it for one purpose or another,
      however, they never keep it for long.  These items possess the
      power to create or destroy kingdoms, what would you do with one?
 
      What is known of the artifacts are only bits and pieces put together
      from the stories of history and what few documents survived the
      cataclysm.  The list of artifacts is as follows:

`W
      His story is lost in the folds of time, a whispered memory on the
      lips of the attentive few.  Who or what it was is unknown, but it
      is said he possessed a power far beyond most, if not all, of the
      higher circle of gods.  Patron to the future GL Empire, this god
      spawned the events that led to the creation of the artifacts and
      what would eventually become the cataclysm.  In a time of struggle
      and chaos, it would be the hand of fate that banished him from the
      world to sit in a dark void forever.  Many of his people herald
      his inevitable return, upon which havoc shall be wrought with
      furious vengence.  His portfolio was quickly adopted and shared
      among the 9 gods that remained, further defiling his memory.

`O-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Y    CENALIN, THE SILVER EMPIRE
`O-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  Little can inspire awe like lines of armored knights charging in unison
  across a battlefield, shimmering in the light of day. Such is the effect 
  the incredibly trained knights of Cenalin give.  Called the "Silver Empire" 
  due to the silver mines and unique armor their knights wear, an alloy of 
  silver and steel, this empire is one that is both feared and admired.
 `W
  Cenalin is located on the continent of Solace.  The closest landmass is
  Zandofen found to the north of Solace.  Alaris lies to the northeast and 
  Lycandria is found east of the continent.  The lands of Solace are 
  home to temperate forests, lush fields, mountainous ranges and deserts.  
  Wonderfully hot summers, cool winters and moderate seasons in between 
  lend near limitless possibilities to the people of this land. The empire 
  itself is ruled via the Royal family and is directly protected by its 
  elite force of knights known as the "Silver Storm".
 `W
  The history of Cenalin begins like all others, shortly after the great
  cataclysm, when the lands were torn asunder and the magical surges changed
  people into all manner of creatures. The forested lands of Cenalin fell 
  into madness with bands of men living like beasts and killing all who came 
  upon them.  This behavior became known as Amens Sanquis and those that 
  became affected, Sanquimen.  Those that remained sane maintained small 
  cloistered villages, cutting back the trees in order to provide warning 
  and rarely mingled with each other.
`W 
  Then without warning, one day the Sanquimen disappeared. The villages
  contacted each other for the first time in decades and a gathering was
  called; members of each village arrived at the clearing, fearful and
  distrustful.  At this gathering, the Sanquimen chose to make their
  reappearance, dropping from the trees like twisted shapes out of a
  nightmare. One among them came forward and announced himself as Ceritus.
  The madness of the Amens Sanquis still lingered about his eyes and in his
  erratic movements but he had gained a measure of control.  He spoke about a
  dream;  a place filled with fire and death where they would find a cure. He
  led the Sanquimen, all of them, to this far away land of scorched ground.
 `W
  They dragged forward five exotic women they took as captives from this land.
  Ceritus took one of them and before the eyes of those gathered, he pierced
  her heart with his blade. As her blood spilled from the wound, he bowed his
  head and drank of the blood, calling forth a power that burned away the
  madness of the Amens Sanquis.  Each woman, one by one, was sacrificed in
  this manner and with each Ceritus grew in power and strength. The villagers
  could only stand and watch, amazed and frightened by what they were
  witnessing.
 `W
  Ceritus became the first blood mage, leading the way for his Sanguimen to
  follow.  These blood mages ruled the villages, every year demanding
  sacrifices be made for them.  But power has a funny way of attracting
  others, and it wasn't long before outside armies began attacking.  The
  villagers were nearly helpless to defend themselves.  The blood mages
  required more and more sacrifices of them, in order to maintain their
  protection.  It wasn't long before the nearly empty villages were overrun.
 `W
  The leader of this band, Arturos the Black, demanded a meeting with Ceritus.
  Upon hearing Arturos' demands, the blood mages and the village men began a 
  partnership. Ceritus became the head counselor to Arturos.  A select few of 
  the men were chosen to join the blood mages, and learn the magic.
 `W
  It was a strong alliance of blood and blade, one that might have lasted for
  centuries.  But Ceritus was greedy for power and killed Arturos in an 
  attempt to overthrow his dominion and seize his armies.  Arturos' men 
  rebelled and tortured Ceritus to death in revenge. Blood magic became 
  illegal to practice, the blood mages taking to the wild forests to hide as 
  their ancestors once did.
 `W
  When it exactly happened is not known, but out of the blood soiled 
  wilderness came a man holding a crystal grail. It is said he possessed 
  an aura that caused men to want to follow him and he went in turn to each 
  little village, uniting them one by one. With the united villages he turned 
  and marched the people into the wilderness away from the settlements they 
  had built, to what many scholars believe to be the origin of the grail.  It 
  was at that central spot that this man, one Jhaspur Bismark, built what 
  would become the largest and most powerful city in all of Solace.
 `W
  Voted king by those about him, he encouraged the study of magic and 
  religion, building great temples to the gods.   Knights began pledging 
  their swords to him, his armies grew, and his people prospered.  It was 
  during this time the silver mines were uncovered and the "Silver Empire" 
  was born.  Jhaspur was king for 50 years before dying and passing the 
  grail to his son, Yamar Bismark.  Leadership of the empire has been in 
  their family ever since.
 `W
  As for the blood mages, most assumed the practice fell away, with the 
  return of the gods and the control of magic.  It is something that very 
  few Cenalins are willing to talk about.

0 Seraphim SORCIA~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`g    THE SULLEN PLAINS OF SORCIA
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  The angry war cries from the nomads of the plains are something that would 
  shake even the iciest berserker from his rage.  Masses of disenchanted 
  folk of all races struggling to survive, battle hardened by the sheer act 
  of living in a kingdom where treacherous beasts, shortages of food and water
  and the occasional swarm of bandits raiding camps for supplies is a daily
  worry and way of life.  To many people that have visited the few areas
  of Sorcia that are permanent, living here is worse than even treks into
  the dark continent.
 
  Sorcia shares the continent of Lycandria with two other kingdoms,
  Alkaan'Caal to the north across the mountains of enlightenment,
  and Arcavo to the south.  The landscape of Sorcia is homogenous from top to
  bottom, a dry and cracked plainscape with sparse growths of dry grasses and
  the random tree or briar bush.  The climate of this vast wasteland varies
  with one's location within the actual kingdom, ranging from dangerously
  hot near the northern coast to unbearably cold far to the south near the
  border of Arcavo.  Storms and tornados are common and are the cause of the
  nomadic nature of the citizens here.
 
  The actual history of Sorcia is mostly hearsay, but the story is passed
  on from generation to generation in hopes of preventing another cataclysm
  such as that which was experienced some 500 years ago.  The area of Sorcia 
  was the actual location of the significant battle that caused the cataclysm
  that all but destroyed the entire world and set the sea to boiling.  On
  the plains of Sorcia the mages gathered to wage their battles, hurling
  magics beyond description at each other.  With the combinations of magic
  the land was literally torn asunder and all life on Sorcia was reduced to
  mere ashes that were blown away by the explosions that followed.
 
  The release of magic exploded in all directions, freezing the south of
  the combat site and burning toward the north.  Massive mountains grew
  out of the soil and volcanoes sprung into being.  Over a year passed
  before those few that survived again stepped forth into the open.  What
  they saw was a land devoid of life and possibilities.  How they survived
  for a year is unknown, but some say cannibalism among other things
  was a major factor.  The first few people that strode out into the open
  found themselves immediately set upon by massive beasts of strange and
  intense natures.  Together they fought back the creatures and when the
  dust settled, they found a glove in the midst of a burnt crater, in the
  exact location of the origin of the magical cataclysm.
 
  They gazed at the glove for a moment before the bravest of them, once a
  man, now some sort of ethereal shadow, Liazus the Faint, approached and
  donned the item.  It was said that his scream could be heard across the
  face of Sorcia as it literally bonded to him.  With this glove burned
  into his hand, he led a series of campaigns grouping the various nomadic
  tribes and placing them all under a single flag.  His rule was extremely
  violent and all who approached to conquer him were felled.  Though he
  allowed the various tribes to move at will, he decreed that they bind
  together in times of danger.  Once bitter enemies would fight shoulder
  to shoulder to protect Sorcia, such was the wisdom of the first Grand
  Chieftain of the Plains.
 
  It is whispered that Liazus still walks the land.  Others say upon his
  death one of his men took the glove and continued to rule in his place.
  The actual location of the artifact is unknown, but when strife befalls
  the kingdom, one can be certain that a shadow creature wearing the glove
  will be seen ahead of the combined armies of nomadic scavengers, their war
  cry echoing across the plains.

      If there is a land of perfection in this forsaken world, it would
      have to be Solace.  The fourth largest continent boasts wonderfully
      hot summers, and cool tolerable winters.  Between the seasons are
      temperate and enjoyable.  One cannot be sure if the pleasant nature
      of the land is reason for the honorable society that has sprung forth
      or if the honorable society is the reason for the pleasant lands.
      Due to its central positioning, it suffered the least effects from
      the magical fallout, its people, though somewhat changed, were the
      least damaged.  The land is incredibly fertile, producing large
      amounts of grain, fruit and animal products.  Its people eat very
      well, in comparison to other lands.  The continent is rich in ores,
      mostly silver and mithril, and its citizens take full advantage of
      this wonderful bounty.

0 Seraphim ALKAAN'CAAL ALKAANCAAL~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`R    THE FIERY WASTES OF ALKAAN'CAAL
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  They arrive in swarms like locusts, clouding the sky and shedding a dark
  shadow upon the land.  Their battle cry echoes against the mountain face
  and ripples over the hills onto the desert sands.  Behind this one feels
  the thunder of thousands of feet charging forward.  What madness is this
  that terrifies so?  None other than the elite draconian wingmen combined
  with the massive minotaur infantry from the desert sands of Alkaan'Caal.
 
  The kingdom of Alkaan'Caal, known as the fiery wastes, is located on the
  continent of Lycandria north of Sorcia.  Unlike Arcavo, there is
  an actual physical border separating it from Sorcia, a mountain range
  known for its violent and often active volcanoes.  The region is primarily
  desert wastes, with some sparse growths near the waters edge, though even
  this is rare and seldom salvageable by the people that live here.  The
  climate is tremendously hot year round, with violent storms and intense
  droughts being commonplace.  Food is always scarce and difficult to find,
  making it oft times more valuable than gold or silver, even platinum.
  Despite the obvious troubles, the people that live here do survive, moving
  from place to place, following the light rains that do come as well as
  the occasional water hole.  There is evidence of some type of trade, but
  with what or whom is completely unknown.
 
  The history of this place began simultaneously with that of Sorcia and
  the even more southern, Arcavo.  When the magical schools went to battle
  on the plains of Sorcia some 500 years ago, their magics combined and
  released a massive amount of energy upon the land.  What energy spread
  north scorched the lands, burning all life it came in contact with to
  ashes.  The land itself ruptured and from the very plain rose mountains
  of incredible heights, volcanoes spewing their fiery storm into the sky,
  blanketing the lands in ash, soot, and lava.
 
  Those that were not incinerated by the flames and lava of the cataclysm did
  come together for survival, but unbeknownst to them, their trials were just
  beginning.  Unlike most places, the magical residue of the cataclysm did not
  fade away in Alkaan'Caal.  It hovered in the air like a cloud of some sort,
  unseen and unheard.  The few people that came to the surface after the major
  tremors and shifting had ceased, were totally unaware that something had
  begun to take hold of them, changing them and altering them permanently.
 
  Among them walked a man known as Alkaan.  He was an apprentice wizard before
  the cataclysm and did not take part in the battles in Sorcia.  His lack of
  involvement led to his overall survival.  Along with the others, they combed
  the desert sands in search of survivors and food.  Days passed and water and
  food could not be found.  The weaker of them collapsed in death, the others
  setting upon them like ravaging vultures.  They could not see the sickness
  in their actions, the magic ate away at their flesh, changing them into what
  they truly were within.  Alkaan knew something was amiss, but he could not
  place his finger upon just what.  He never did eat the fallen.
 
  It was some time later, a few days perhaps, maybe a few weeks, that the
  group had dwindled down to its last few dozen people.  They were starving,
  parched, nearing the edge of madness.  Most of them had lost their hair,
  others had strange growths from their forehead, confusion and panic set in.
  Alkaan was unchanged and the others hated him for it.  They conspired
  against him and in a fit of desperation, he fled one night when they all
  slept.  For 10 days and nights Alkaan wandered the desert alone, feasting
  off of corpses and muddy water holes he happened across.  All would change
  on the 10th night of his wanderings, when he collapsed into a deep coma,
  and dreamt of a massive bird of pure fire, whose wings extended as far as
  the horizon.  From this bird fell a massive pinion toward the ground that 
  exploded in a beautiful shower of colored flames that illuminated the night 
  sky.
 
  How long he slept was unknown, even to Alkaan, but when he was awakened
  he found himself drastically altered.  His clothing was charred and his
  face and features were grotesque and awkward.  His hands and skins were
  much larger, scaled.  He was remarkably calm and he stood to examine his
  body.  He had changed, into a draconian, a reptilian man with the
  qualities of a dragon.  He found himself immune to the effects of the
  terrible heat and though his hunger soared, he was able to handle it much 
  more easily.  At his feet, nearly buried by the sand was the pinion from 
  his dream, bathed in a strange series of colored flames.  This he took 
  bravely into his claws and promptly called his own.
 
  He flew into the sky, his newfound instincts having alerted him of his
  wings and the ability to soar.  Toward the mountains he flew, where he now
  saw his former people in the throes of agony, some already changed into
  draconians, among other races, some still completely dehydrated humans.
  With his own magical powers, and that of the phoenix pinion, he rallied
  the few groups of his people together and began anew the scouring of the
  lands.  Those that became draconians took to the air behind Alkaan, he
  that possessed the pinion.  Those that did not formed roving bands on the
  desert sands.  They were breathtaking to watch.  Together they raged on
  the desert, fighting back the irrational beasts that climbed out from the
  bowels of the world, and collecting those people that still huddled in
  dark places, hiding from the cataclysm.
 
  Upon his death, his minions gathered around.  A young and thin draconian
  stood by her former liege and wept tears that fell upon his reptilian
  frame and burned him.  The phoenix pinion burst into flames but was not
  consumed.  The young draconian took the pinion into her hands and it was
  so that the torch of leadership was passed.  Since then it has been a
  tradition, that he or she that holds the pinion would rule the desert
  wastelands until the firebird would return home for it.  The land was
  later called, Alkaan'Caal, in solemn remembrance for those that calmed
  the storm and made life in the wastes bearable.

`W    THE BARREN TUNDRA OF ARCAVO
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  Mouths agape, frothing with foam and saliva.  Teeth gnawing the wood of
  their shields as others, in like fury, bang their axes and swords against
  their chests, armor and shields.  If it sounds like madness then you are
  just beginning to understand what it is like to stand before the armed
  masses of one of the many clans of berserkers from Arcavo, the Ice lands.
  It is perhaps to the benefit of all others that the clans are not truly
  unified, for if they were, the world would have much to stress over.
`W
  Arcavo exists as the southern most country upon the incredibly large
  continent of Lycandria. It borders the kingdom of Sorcia which lies 
  northwest, Alaris and Solace lies west of the continent.  Arcavo is a 
  quiet, barren place of barbaric men, dangerously vicious beasts, and 
  a climate of constant sub-zero temperatures.  Violent storms come and 
  go, and frequent shifts of ice plates are a way of life.
`W
  The history of Arcavo is irrevocably intertwined with that of Sorcia
  and Alkaan'Caal.  At the moment of the cataclysm, when energies were let
  loose to tear the entire world asunder, the lands of Arcavo were created.
  Pure streams of cold air and ice erupted from the ground and flooded the
  southern lands, freezing it permanently, same as Alkaan'Caal far to
  the north was set ablaze.  Those that were not frozen immediately huddled
  together in chilled masses, praying to gods that would not help them.
`W
  In time those that huddled together were less afraid and entered the
  frozen wastes together.  Each group, separated by miles, formed amongst
  themselves clans, with leaders and various rituals.  The lack of gods led
  to the rise of shamans and their quasi-magical actions.  Again life was
  found amidst the plateaus and tundra of the ice lands.  But things would
  not be so simple.  In time the clans met with one another, and as food
  and clean water was so difficult to find, they were soon at war with one
  another and the lands wept tears of crimson blood.
`W
  For many years a constant series of wars took place.  Clans were
  nearly exterminated, others rose in power, only to fall with the coming
  winter.  Food was scarce, and the warring made it even more difficult to
  find food.  It was during an extremely brutal winter, the year is not
  known, however it is known the clans lay on the verge of starvation and
  destruction when each man felt, simultaneously, a pulsing warmth coming
  from the center of Arcavo.  As though controlled, they all rose and
  donned their warmest furs and set out, clans from each direction toward
  this location.
`W
  Each clan arrived from different directions and stood atop the plateau
  gazing down upon a small valley amidst the snowy heights where there stood
  a single man who held in his hand a small, glowing stone that pulsed to the
  same beat as the warmth they were feeling.  Each stood there in awe, gazing
  upon the stone with a strange reverence.  In the hours to come they would
  be led to a massive cavern where a huge feast was set out, served and
  prepared by the clan of this mysterious man with the glowing rock.  Each
  clan sat down and feasted, laughing and drinking mead and telling stories
  of valor.  They traded goods and clothing, food and other such things.
  All were happy and joyful, save one man that coveted the stone, Faias.
`W
  Towards the end of the evening when all were giggling and singing in their
  drunken stupors and preparing for sleep to head out to their own lands in
  the tundra, Faias crept forth, axe in hand to kill the man that held the
  pulsing stone.  With a war cry common among those of the clans, his lifted
  the axe and slammed it squarely into the chest of the man.  His lifeless
  body slumped and the stone rolled out of his palm and onto the floor where
  it glowed brighter than it had before.  Faias took the stone into his hand
  and held it up towards the others in hopes of controlling them, as the
  stranger had.  Instead he saw himself staring into the mad, insane eyes of
  his former clansmen.  They began to stir wildly, chewing on their shields
  and banging their heads into the walls of the cavern.
`W
  Faias found himself in awe of the sheer ferocity of his own people and
  dropped the stone, preparing to flee.  It was then that a man known among
  the barbarians as Amrith leapt forward with axe in hand.  His eyes were
  enraged and his mouth overflowed with foam, it was as though he were rabid
  and growing in size.  They two fought viciously, for though Faias was
  afraid he was still a southlander, and stronger than oxen.  Amrith cared
  nothing for Faias' skill and walked into the axe as though it were nothing.
  Faias was afraid, unable to face this berserk beast that ignored the power
  of the axe on his shoulder.  Soon after Faias fell to the ground...dead.
`W
  The stone, one of the ten great artifacts, aptly named the Heart of the

`b    TYREAN, EMPIRE OF THE WHITE FLAME
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  Imagine if you will a single mass of soldiers, hundreds of thousands in
  number, yet totally and completely focused toward a single goal.  Each
  person in perfect sync with the other, each person in absolute under-
  standing of their position.  This only begins to touch the essence of
  what the White Flame encompasses.  Each man, woman and child are ranked
  in this totalitarian empire in which every registered person is given
  training and rank within the armed forces.  They are relentless and will
  never surrender, when a leader falls in battle, immediately another will
  rise.  There is a terrible beauty about it all.
`W
  The small kingdom of Tyrean is located at the northern end of Alaris and
  borders the domineering kingdom of Estmina.  The two kingdoms almost
  never cease in their war over border definition, natural resources, and
  control of the continent of Alaris itself.  The continent itself is
  located northeast of Lycandria, while its southern tip is also a few
  hundred miles northeast of the northern edge of Lycandria.  Tyrean
  enjoys a wondrously warm climate year round, due mostly to the close
  proximity to Alkaan'Caal.  Seldom are there dangerous storms, and they
  enjoy a rich bounty of animal life, cattle and a variety of fruits and
  grain.  The military nature of Tyrean, and the rapidly growing population
  keeps most of the resources in house and their trade is very limited.
`W
  The history of what eventually became Tyrean is clouded, stories tainted
  by time and myth.  The most popular story begins, of course, moments
  after the cataclysm rocked the cradle of the world.  When all would run
  and cower in caves beneath the surface away from the fires and magic in
  the sky, their rose a single child.  The name of the little girl is lost
  in time, but it is said her fury at the gods for their judgment defied
  even the mandates of the gods of war, chaos and death.  The gods, though
  silent, admired this child and blessed her purity of self.  In a moment
  when all around her were succumbing to the alterations of the magic, she
  remained unchanged, eternally lost in her fury.
`W
  When many of the changes had occurred, and people calmed in their screams
  of agony, the gods quietly bestowed upon this child a final gift.  The
  gods set her voice upon the cymbals of war, and her very words mandated
  the sounding of thunder.  People crept from their holes and crypts to
  listen to this child.  The years that followed, called "The Gathering"
  to the people of Tyrean, were spent unifying everyone.  The child in
  her purity of thought treated everyone as equals, regardless of race,
  sex or heritage.
`W
  The people trained then, each ranked according to detailed scriptures.
  Man and woman, child and senior, walked together as a single wave.
  Ahead of this growing army walked a single child.  Their movement
  swept across the face of the land, destroying the utterly defiled and
  uniting the few last bands that scavenged like animals.  The child was
  absolute in her resolve and accepted no weakness.  Her essential use
  of fairness and justice made her a hero among the people.
`W
  As with all godly gifts, the child's might was temporary, and upon
  the declaration of the Empire of Tyrean, she collapsed to the dismay
  of the army.  As they were trained, one immediately stepped up to
  assume the command, chaos was not known among them.  He stood over
  the body of the child and all watched as she erupted into a white
  flame that consumed her body.  The man reached into the flame without
  fear and was consumed as well, though not burned.  In a brilliant
  flash, the child was gone, and all that remained was this man, palm
  outstretched with an eternally burning flame dancing thereon.
`W
  This young man, named Asim, would found the empire and through him
  massive cities were erected, and societies of complete and utter
  order.  His rule was not peaceful however, as a growing force to
  the north moved south in efforts to purge their beliefs.  Waving
  the banner of Estmina, these soldiers marched into the lands of
  Tyrean expecting an easy conquest over the simple villages of the
  newly found Empire.  Little did they know that the children and
  women they scoffed at were as well trained as they.
`W
  The war raged on for years, neither side faltering to the other.
  The soldiers of the White Flame fought relentlessly and without
  fear.  All would be decided on a fateful night when General Asim
  would meet with the leader of the Estmina forces and pursue then
  honorable combat beneath the blanket of the sky.  The battle raged
  on for a complete moon after which both men, in unbridled skill and
  passion, struck one another dead there before the agape maws of
  two armies.
`W
  As though a herald of change, the armies of Estmina shuddered in
  relative confusion, those of Tyrean adapted immediately and a young
  woman stepped forward to assume command.  Before further battle
  could occur, the two bodies of the honorable generals exploded in
  a shower of white flame, a wall rose and spread over the assumed
  border of the two Kingdoms, a wall neither side could pass.  The
  war had ended briefly, though each time the wall faded, the two
  sides would again find themselves locked in combat, neither truly
  losing, neither truly winning.
`W
  The young woman who stepped forward after the death of Asim was
  said to have possessed the flame, and another after her death.
  The truth of the matter has been lost in the annals of time.
  What is sure, is that the two Kingdoms, of Estmina and Tyrean,
  will never rest, each vying for control over the continent, each
  matching the other evenly.  Rumors are spreading of a possible
  expansion into the sea for those of Tyrean, but none can be
  certain of the fact of that matter.

`G    THE COLLECTED LANDS OF ESTMINA
`g-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
  The very trembling of the ground heralds their approach.  Lines a mile
  long marching in complete unison towards their goal.  Those that do not
  join with them are decimated, those that do are trained and merged into
  the body of the army.  This could accurately describe the gathered force
  of Estmina and her military.  Perhaps the only actual confederacy in the
  world, they survive by conquering and assimilating all towns and people
  on the continent and unifying them under a single banner, that or
  destroying them outright.
`W
  Located on the southern end of Alaris, the collected lands of Estmina are
  quite possibly the largest empire on the face of E'dhora.  Estmina
  shares the continent with the kingdom of Tyrean and the two are often
  at war over resources and border disputes.  The continent itself is
  located west of Lycandria, and its northeastern tip is also a few
  hundred miles west from the southwest edge of AlkaanCaal. Estmina
  enjoys temperate weather all year round and seldom are there any
  seriously powerful weather conditions, on either extreme.  The land
  of Alaris is rich in grain and cattle, and trade between the smaller
  states of the confederacy are extremely profitable.
`W
  The history of Estmina is a simple one, filled with tales of battle and
  constant war.  The story begins as most others, directly after the major
  cataclysm that sent the land that is now Alaris hurtling through the once
  boiling oceans toward the northeast.  The people huddled beneath the
  surface of the land, praying in vain to the gods they had disrespected.
  The gods turned their backs on the people, all save those that cared for
  death and war and mayhem.  Of those praying, an avatar appeared before
  the  most faithless of them all.  Unto him was bestowed an orb which held
  a soft glow and was warm to the touch.  His mind was filled with thoughts
  of battle, of an empire which spread from coast to coast.  Through him
  the people saw power and possibility, a crusade had begun.
`W
  Guided by the corruption of the orb this man, who's name has long since
  been forgotten, though many scholars say it was Estmina, began a long
  series of campaigns against the few collections of people.  He taught
  them the meaning of unity, though corrupt, and that conquest meant their
  survival.  Each different set of people were given rules and regulations
  and left alone to survive.  States of little nations were formed, all under
  the banner of Estmina.  Those that resisted were met with force and
  wars ensued.  This continued onward for years upon years.
`W
  In time this man, walked ahead of a massive army.  Some areas of the large
  continent of Alaris put up adequate defenses, others were exterminated in
  mere weeks.  Groups of people either joined or died on the spot.  Labeled
  a madman his campaigns spread far toward the southern border of the lands
  where the records say he set down to sleep and never woke.  One of his
  generals were said to have acquired the orb thereafter and continued the
  campaigns south.  Again they met with opposition, but this time it was of
  a different and more drastic nature.
`W
  They met with a force of people who huddled beneath the banner of the first
  empire of Tyrean.  These people were not like the small hamlets and villages
  previously encountered, these people were well trained and their military
  strategy was incredibly acute and effective.  Estmina and Tyrean went to
  war immediately.  Losses on both sides were massive, at times Estmina's
  troops would have to retreat, other times Tyrean had to flee.  The two
  forces would not surrender to one another, however, and battle raged on for
  almost twelve years before a change would occur.
`W
  By now the casualties were tremendous, more so on the side of Estmina, as
  even the children of Tyrean were trained in some sort of combat.  What
  would be called a milestone in their struggles occurred on the evening of
  the White wolf, when the twin moons were full and their light illuminated
  the battlefield.  The generals of both sides came to the front, each one
  possessing an item of tremendous power.  On the side of Estmina, General
  Uraithi held in his hands the orb given to the people of Estmina so long
  ago, and on the side of Tyrean, in the opened palm of General Asim, was
  a beautiful, ever-burning, white flame.
`W
  The two charged forward, surrounded by the energies of their respective
  artifacts.  What occurred could only be spoken of as poetry, so beautiful
  was their fury that men on both sides wept.  For 30 days they did battle
  taking only the briefest of rests to eat, drink and recuperate, which
  was allowed as battle was a noble act in those days.  Neither man would
  give an inch, neither asked for quarter.  Each man on both sides watched
  in awe at the uncompromising ferocity of both until it happened...
`W
  Simultaneously, both men who were so equally matched, leapt forward with a
  killing blow, both moves struck home and the men fell atop one another in
  the center of the field.  The silence was so, that a leaf falling in the
  distance echoed as would thunder.  For the first time, perhaps, in all of
  history the two artifacts also lay there, together, touching one another.
  In what could be called a silent explosion, both bodies were incinerated
  and where the artifacts lay, a massive wall of white flame erupted from
  the ground, blocking both groups from one another.  On the side of those
  from Estmina, confusion and anger set in.  That is until one man stepped
  forward with the orb in hand.  Lord Yreal Hanoud.  With the orb he stepped
  up and took command of the confederate states of Estmina.
`W
  Since that day, the two forces have fought constantly, as the barrier of
  white flame is not eternal.  Each time the two kingdoms would collide as
  though compelled to do so, drawn toward each other.  Oft times it would
  be Estmina that began the skirmish, but occasionally, Tyrean would cross
  the border to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting enemy.  What is a constant
  however is that at the end of each major battle, before either side can
  eliminate the other, a massive wall of white flame erupts, separating the
  two people.  Whether or not this is done intentionally by the people of
  Tyrean is unknown.
`W
  The collected lands of Estmina thrives to this day, its armed forces a 
  brigand of madman of various races and skill levels.  At the end of each
  skirmish, that wall of white fire is again erected and used to shut out
  the people of Estmina.  Currently there are rumors of expansion into the
  boiling sea, one thing is for sure, these people thrive on conquest and 
  control.

`W
  Control.  There would be no other way to describe the sheer ruthlessness
  of these people.  They washed over the land like a wave, immediately
  asserting power of those people they encountered, and utterly wiping out
  those that resisted.  Unlike Estmina, they do not compromise, they do
  not negotiate.  Those that do not comply are destroyed.  These soldiers
  possess frightening magics and technologies, things unseen anywhere else
  in the world.  Their motto is simple and unyielding in reproach,
  "Those that oppose the Empire will die!"
`W
  The GL Empire is primarily located on the island continent of Zandofen,
  though rumors abound of them having already spread to the islands
  sprinkled all about.  Relatively distant from all other Kingdoms, the
  Empire is both protected and confined.  The sea, the only entity they
  have yet to truly master, keeps them at bay, perhaps to the benefit of
  the entire world.  The climate of Zandofen is strangely moderate for
  being so far north, many will say due to the strange meta-magics used.
  Their resources are plentiful and the people, though chaotic, rarely
  want for much.  What drives them to conquest, then, must be the sheer
  thrill of victory over others.
`W
  The history of the GL Empire is the strangest of all the known Empires
  in that it speaks of blasphemous possibilities, none of which can be
  proven, but none of which could be disproved.  Of these stories, there
  are many variations, but the most popular of them begins not after the
  cataclysm as with the others, but many centuries before.  It has
  been told that in the times lost, there were eleven great gods that
  held mandate over the heavens and the world of E'dhora below.  Of these
  eleven, one fighter-god was favored by a select group of people upon 
  which he bestowed the crafts and technologies of heaven.
`W
  The other gods in their anger would manufacture 9 artifacts to spread
  throughout the rest of the world to match that of these people.  What
  would occur was a bountiful golden age, of philosophy and invention
  that would allow mankind to grow and flourish.  In the time leading
  up to the cataclysm, the elder god knew the time of man was coming to
  an end, and against the wishes of his brethren set his favored few
  apart and told them of the disaster to come.  Holed within a section
  of land, the god taught them great technologies that would protect
  them from the coming storm, with this he gave them a single relic, an
  emblem in the shape of a sun.  To one man alone she whispered its
  meaning...
`W
  The cataclysm would hit furiously, and the land now known as Zandofen
  resisted the storm and instead of vanishing from the world went
  hurtling through the sea to land far apart from the other lands.  The
  people did suffer, so thorough was the power of the gods, but they
  did not lose as much as many would think, and were protected somewhat
  from the altering of the magical residue.  The other gods were insane
  with rage when they found out of the interference of the elder god,
  they bound together to banish him.  For a time the gods warred among
  themselves, the reason for their silence to the world.  Their war did
  much to spread the waves of magical residue that altered the world.
`W
  A young girl, it is said, stepped forth among the gods and with but
  a single word, ended the war.  It was said her judgment banished the
  elder god, and set the others to resurrecting their faith among the
  people.  For the first time the people of the GL Empire were alone,
  their patron having been banished.  Within them grew a hatred for the
  world, a need to control it, to show the other gods the might of the
  lost.  Armed with the technologies saved from the cataclysm and the
  mysterious sun emblem, they began a ravenous campaign that took the
  complete control of Zandofen.
`W
  Massive cities and mega-complexes grew, sign of their furious rage
  and knowledge.  Strange flying devices and meta-magical equipment
  raged supreme.  The Empire have never seen defeat, and those few that
  have ever reached their shores were utterly annihilated.  It is said
  campaigns into the mysterious Abbadon have begun.  What is known for
  a fact is that the Empire waits for their chance, they lie silently
  as would a cat who awaits the mouse.  The question remains, is the
  world prepared for their conquest?

`W
      Alaris, the second largest continent of E'dhora, is a beautiful and
      fertile land with lush rolling hills, vast forests, and miles upon
      miles of farming lands growing most anything imaginable.  It has a
      very pleasant climate year round, which leads to an abundance of
      food and natural resources.  While the populations of the people and
      animals are continually growing, it is safe, more so than any other
      continent, from losing its stores of supplies.  Sharing its land
      between two kingdoms, Alaris sees her share of war and battle, but
      if the blood spilled on her naturally dark soil is harmful, she is
      reluctant to say.  Local folklore, in fact, speaks to the contrary,
      the blood enriches the soil, and in such, her people.

`W
      Affectionately called "The Seat of the World", Lycandria is by
      far the largest continent on the face of E'dhora. It is the 
      location of the cataclysm's beginning, and the home to the three 
      kingdoms of Alkaan'Caal, Arcavo, and Sorcia.  Lycandria is a 
      truly damned land, forsaken by the gods and relatively without 
      any resources and natural life.  Far to the north it blazes in 
      a relative inferno, vast deserts and volcanoes, violent storms 
      and that dry ever-present heat.  Far to the south it shivers in 
      the utter cold of Arcavo.  Snow and ice are commonplace there, 
      blizzards and other terrible storms occur almost daily.  Those 
      that live there must huddle together for warmth and travel from 
      place to place just to search for food.  Finally, there is Sorcia.  
      To the world it is ground zero, scorned due to the history it has
      in relation to the problems of the world.  Sorcia is both hot
      and cold at the relative borders, vast wastelands of cracked
      soil and sparse growths of inedible plants.  It is true, this
      place is forsaken, scorned, and hated.

Avatar Seraphim STYLE~
Keep the name list of objects and mobs short, one or a few words.  Do not
put articles and conjunctions in the name field.  The name is used to refer
to an object or a mob, so if you name a mob "The King of the Dwarves", you
can type things like "kill of" and "con the".  Do not capitalize the words
in the name list, and DO NOT put color codes in the name field of an object
or a mob.

Short descriptions should be a phrase, while long descriptions should be
complete sentences.  Do not capitalize the first letter of a short
  description, since it's a phrase, and don't put a period at the end.  DO
capitalize the first letter of a long description, and DO put a period (or
exclamation mark or whatever) at the end.

Do not reset an object or a mob from a different area into your area.  Sure
it'll work, when you create the reset.  Until the mud reboots.  Then it
will crash.  And reboot.  And crash.  And reboot.  Get the picture?
Seems every new builder makes this mistake at least once :).

Do not put fake extra flags on an object, such as "(pretty) an orchid".
This is tacky and in bad style.  Yes we already have such objects on the
mud.  But just because some other idiot did it doesn't mean you have to be
an idiot also.
 
Double check the spelling and grammar on your descriptions!

Avoid excessive use of the word "you" in room descriptions.  In particular
don't tell the player what they're feeling.  It seems pretty silly, for
instance, for a vampire to be told how good the warmth of the sun feels, or
for a player to be told "a feeling of dread overcomes you" when the source
of same is the 40th level mob in your 20-30 level area, and the player is
level 100.  Along the same lines a phrase such as "you feel the hairs on the
back of your neck rise" would be inappropriate for (say) a Dragon or an
elemental.  Some muds go so far as to disallow the word "you" from any
description altogether, but I feel that's going a little too far.  I have no
problem with phrases such as "to the north you see...", but even something
such as "above you the ceiling arches high overhead" might not apply if the
character is flying (but a phrase such as "the ceiling arches high over the
floor" would be okay).

Don't assume the player is going in a particular direction; a phrase like
"as you ascend the stairs..." would be out of place if the player is
descending the stairs.  A common place for this kind of thing to slip in is
the first room of an area (where it's linked to the rest of the mud) or the
first room on the other side of a closed door.  However if travel is only
possible in one direction, such as by means of a series of one-way links,
then this would be okay.

`z
    Basic Guidelines:
`W
`B    *`WWhen writing descriptions don't tell players how to feel.      
 `W
`B    *`WRoom descriptions should be at least 4 lines.  Each line can have 
     80 characters.            
`W
`B    *`WNo snooping other areas.  Only if the builder invites you are you 
     allowed to walk their area.
`W 
`B    *`WUse the autocommands always for weapons, armor, and mobs.
`W
`B    *`WNever create an object named auction.  It will interfere with the auction code.
`W 
`B    *`WFollow price and bonus stat guidelines to maintain balance.  Additional
     bonus stats may be added in special circumstances, such as a quest reward
     object or eq from a really tough mob.  Use good judgment.  
`W 
`B    *`WForsaken is coded for specific colors to be associated with sectors.  
     Room descriptions should be created using the default sector colors most 
     of the time.  For the rare exceptions, the builder may add the color in 
     the description in REDIT to override the sector colors.   
`W 
`B    *`WColors on objects should also be rarely used.   Players will be allowed 
     rewards that allow them to alter personal weapons and armor.  Let's leave 
     the colorful stuff for our players to design.
`W 
`B    *`WAddaffects on objects should be used in moderation and based on the 
     following standard.  For objects (armor or weapon) level 49 or less, 
     ONE affect may be added.   Objects level 50 and above may have TWO 
     affects added.   See help addaffect for details.
`W
`B    *`WIf an object has spell invokes, it can't have any affects.
`W
`B    *`WJust prior to an area being changed out of prototype, areas are open 
     for all builders to review and give feedback.
`W
`B    *`WWe are a team here, we check each other's spelling and make sure 
     the area works well; this is the fun part of our job.
`W 
`B    *`WDo not create an area for your personal use, think about what 
     Forsaken lacks, and create it.

    Each month has seven weeks of six days each.  They are named
    the Moon, Deception, Thunder, Freedom, the Great Gods and the Sun.

    There are exactly seven weeks in each month.  Since this conveniently
    makes the calendar so regular, the weeks also have names; Darkness,
    Tears, Toil, the Dragon, the Shadows, the Battle and Atonement.

    can even go to a specific page to read it again.  For example read 2 
    will allow you to read page 2.  Open book 3 will open the book you're 
    holding to page 3.  However remember if you're holding other books they 
    may interfere.  Just tuck the extra books in a container to resolve this.  
    When you have finished reading, the book can be closed and tucked away.

    Multiplay, or "crossing characters" can mean several things, all 
    of them bad. At its simplest, multiplaying is having more than one 
    character logged on at the same time, and this is strictly against 
    the rules. It can, however, mean other things. The most common 
    mistake that mudders make is to think that because one of their 
    characters knows something, that all of them do. It is essential 
    that people understand that each and every character is a "person" 
    unto itself. This means you cannot, in ANY WAY, help your own 
    characters. Do not get corpses, do not get eq, do not use them 
    to kill the guy that is picking on your new character. It's absolutely 
    against the rules here, simply don't do it.

`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    A fearsome and secretive race, the true origin of the draconian is 
    still a mystery to the inhabitants of E'dhora.  Thought to be created 
    by a magician, draconians have become a large part of the population 
    in the realm.  Moderate sized beasts that tower over smaller races, 
    draconians resemble a more man-like version of a dragon.  The tail of 
    the draconans may help them on the battle field, but when they aren't 
    fighting their quick temper causes them trouble since the world isn't 
    often tolerable to their quick remarks.  A physically strong race 
    indeed, the draconians are as intelligent and deadly with magic as 
    they are with a sword or spear, making them one of the most feared 
    creatures in all of E'dhora.

    them.  The continents are `YAbbadon`W, `YAlaris`W, `YLycandria`W, `YSolace`W, and `YZandofen`W.

`C    SOLDIER
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The extraordinary amount of soldiers that the world of E'dhora has birthed
    is not happenstance. Soldiers are as much a resource as forests, mines, and 
    farmland.  Almost every race of E'dhora has soldiers of one sort or another.
    Trained to endure the harsh rigors of infantry warfare, soldiers are among 
    the hardiest individuals to face in personal combat. Skilled with a wide 
    assortment of weaponry, conditioned to wear the heaviest armor, experienced 
    at traversing terrain of all sorts, the average soldier is a force to be 
    reckoned with. Those rare soldiers that decide to give up their structured 
    life for the unknown one of an adventurer are, out of necessity, a great 
    deal more than average.  Rather than the automaton behavior of their 
    brethren, these soldiers tend to have rather forceful personalities. Some 
    are paragons of honor and virtue; others are the basest of brutes. Some 
    are the physical epitome of a soldier; while others seem incapable of 
    defeating the weakest of foes. A soldier may seek glory, fame, riches, or 
    honor outside of their country, Lord, or Generals service; but in their 
    heart of hearts they will always be a soldier.

    the world. No matter what one chooses to believe the facts of alchemy 
    are well-guarded secrets of those that practice it. It is known that 
    alchemists are incorrigibly curious about the states of matter and the 
    processes by which changes in those states can be brought about. The most 
    interesting, to nearly penniless Lords, is the process by which common 
    metals can be converted into precious ones. Alchemists themselves though 
    will experiment with just about whatever they can imagine. There is a 
    tale of one alchemist succeeding in creating a potion to change the very 
    air to rock... only to have the massive boulder he created crush him dead.  
    Those alchemists that choose to wander the lands are said to be in search 
    of new inspiration for a concoction that will elevate their name to 
    legendary status... at least among fellow alchemists.

`C    CAVALIER
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The Prime Race, the humans, quickly learned they needed a way to offset 
    many of the physical advantages the Forsaken Races had gained over them 
    in terms of fighting wars. Thus some enterprising human Lord, some time 
    after the Cataclysm, reinvented the modern cavalry. These men are 
    mercilessly trained in horsemanship, and the care of their mounts, until 
    it seems as though man and horse are one. In the days before the Cataclysm, 
    when horse-riding was largely viewed as a gentlemens sport, there had 
    been two categories of cavalry for mock events: light and heavy. There 
    was little time, or resources, to effectively equip two types of horseman 
    so the first cavaliers were trained for either role and expected to adapt 
    to any situation. So the modern-day cavalier is able to wield a lance for 
    a charge of heavy horse as well as swing a horse-saber with the lethal 
    effectiveness of a skirmisher.  As adventurers, cavaliers are formidable 
    opponents, and are easily capable of taking on several fully-armed and 
    armored soldiers. The reasons a cavalier would leave the glory-ridden life 
    of their chosen profession are many but primarily revolve around the need 
    for personal glory and riches.

0 Seraphim ELEMENTALIST~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    ELEMENTALIST
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Elementalist are beings who have so dedicated themselves to the study, 
    and protection, of nature that they have gained access to the very power 
    of the elements.  Unlike mages, who bend the elements to very unnatural 
    ends, elementalists give themselves over to the power of nature and in 
    doing so are able to take on many of the aspects of those elements. 
    Communication with a wide variety of animals, even plants, is one such 
    gift that the elements bestow upon their chosen. The ability to magically 
    merge with their surroundings is another. This profession finds it nearly 
    impossible to clothe themselves in heavy alloys and prefer simple cloth 
    garments. To think that an elementalist is without protection is foolhardy 
    for there are whispers of these beings changing their skin to the hardest 
    ores as they effortlessly destroyed hordes intent on ravaging lands under 
    their protection.  Elementalists are protectors by nature and finding an 
    aggressive elementalist would be a hard, but not impossible, thing to do. 
    Those that chose to go adventuring keep their reasons close but it is 
    thought that they are sent out by a secret coalition of elementalists to 
    ensure that another Cataclysm never takes place.

0 Seraphim HUNTER~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    HUNTERS
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    As the title of this profession implies, these are beings that live for 
    the hunt. Skilled with bow and blade, trained for stealth in virtually 
    any terrain, able to track anything that breathes, the hunter is truly 
    at home in the wilds of E'dhora.  The types of prey that the hunter hunts
    are as varied as the hunters themselves so these individuals are capable 
    of laying traps for all but the largest game. A solitary path do most 
    hunters trod, they are rarely seen in the company of other hunters, 
    perhaps because they truly wish to be free of the binding social conformity 
    that comes with belonging to a society. Hunters are perhaps the rarest of 
    adventurers because to do so would push them into the societies they spend 
    much of their lives avoiding.

0 Seraphim MYSTIC~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    MYSTIC
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    These are those that chose to give themselves over to the will of the 
    Gods and in doing so gain a small measure of divine power. The power 
    of a mystic is inexorably tied to their faith. They can heal all but 
    the most mortal wounds and cure all but the most dreadful illnesses. 
    There are rumors that the most pious mystics can even beseech their 
    God to resurrect those they deem worthy. Mystics also are gifted, 
    maybe burdened, with magic that can harm as well. While not strictly 
    trained in the way that mages are in the use of their magic, mystics 
    are more capable physically. They train themselves to wear armor, wield 
    blunt weapons, and to do battle against those their God demands. Sometimes
    a God may need a strong arm to do their will and that arm will always be 
    their mystics.

`C    NECROMANCER
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    No one knows where the first necromancer came from but it is believed 
    there were none before the Cataclysm. These individuals are akin to 
    mages in that they bend the natural order in order to suit their wills. 
    Necromancers primarily concern themselves with life force and the ways 
    it can be bent to their will. Power over death also falls within the 
    necromancers sphere of influence. They are capable of resurrecting 
    souls for whatever purposes they see fit. Once resurrected most 
    creatures are completely under the necromancers control. Unlike 
    mystics, the resurrection of a soul is a thing of force, for the 
    necromancer must rip the soul from whatever place it had journeyed 
    to. Some believe it is not possible for a mortal to do such a thing 
    without divine assistance. Necromancers also have the ability to 
    enslave undead of many sorts as long as the undead creature is not 
    more powerful than the necromancer. Many necromancers go without 
    encumbering armor, as they can merely send their enslaved undead to 
    fight for them.

0 Seraphim VALKYRIE~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    VALKYRIE
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Human women were treated as little more than breeders for years after 
    the Cataclysm and that was something no strong-willed woman would 
    tolerate. It is said that an ambitious Lady fled her Lords lands with 
    nearly all of the women that had been virtual slaves there. She was 
    aided by a number of cavaliers and in the ensuing years, out of 
    desperate necessity, they taught the women willing all they knew 
    of mounted warfare. For some hundred years various female tribes 
    made themselves into a fierce fighter-society. One year, during 
    a fierce war, this society rode out of their hidden place deep in 
    the wilds and tore themselves a place in history with blade and heart. 
`W    
    The valkyrie, as they came to be called, are generally far more fierce 
    and aggressive than their cavalier counterparts. Some chose to learn 
    the lance; but many of the valkyrie are too small to effectively use 
    the large device. Thus the valkyrie became especially skilled with 
    the saber. In modern-times valkyrie can be found in any land where 
    there is human civilization but there are tales that a hidden enclave 
    of the true Valkyrie resides somewhere in E'dhora.

`C    DREAM_CONCEPT
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
    DEDIT is used by administrators to create add a dream. Dreams may be 
    nightmares or normal.  They may be directed toward a gender, class, 
    and race.  Affects may also be added to place a bonus or penalty on 
    the dream.
`W
    The player can wake up at any time if it's a normal dream, but the 
    affect if any will not be applied. The player cannot wake up or be 
    woken by another player if they're having a nightmare. Being attacked 
    while sleeping will always wake them up of course, canceling any dream 
    in progress even if a nightmare. If a player is having a nightmare 
    others in the room may see them tossing and turning in their sleep. 
`W
    The last two dreams a player had are stored in their pfile, so neither 
    of those dreams will repeat until the player has had two more dreams. 
    The typical dream will have about four to six segments of one to six 
    lines of text each, however this isn't a hard fast rule.  It will vary 
    based on dream purpose and the creator.  Currently sleep spells or progs 
    will not start the dream code.  However if a mob forces a player to 
    sleep it is possible for the player to start dreaming.
`W  
    Staff who write dreams should add the fade into the dream in the 
    first segment and a fade back into sleep if a normal dream.  Dreams 
    may be written for questing purposes or to support areas or roleplay, 
    or may be completely out of the minds of the creative staff.  All dreams 
    should be posted to the forum.  As the dreams are added to Forsaken, the 
    dream is removed off the forum.
`W  
    Administrators may direct selected dreams toward players.

0 Seraphim TITAN~
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C  TITANS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Titans are gargantuan, almost godlike men and women.  They, quite 
    simply, look like 25 foot tall people of great physical strength 
    and beauty.  They are commonly dressed in traditional garb, favoring
    togas, loincloths, and such.  However, if they find armor large enough
    to fit them, a titan may embellish him or herself in decorative armor.
    They wear rare and valuable jewelry and in other ways make themselves
    seem beautiful and overpowering.  Titans are very close to nature but 
    at times they may venture into cities.  They select very carefully what
    cities they choose to roam because their large size makes it very 
    difficult to move around in the small structures.
`W 
    Titans tend to be skilled alchemists, mages, mystics, and exceptional
    soldiers.  Titans also have the ability to tolerate fire and cold 
    extremely well.

`W
    Pose is a command that can be used by a player to present oneself in 
    a unique manner.  It can be changed and updated to suit role play 
    situations and settings.  When pose is on, it replaces the standard 
    display that is seen by other players when they look in the room.  
    For example: if a pose is set to "Moreta is standing on the edge of 
    the ferry looking at the ocean." it will replace, "Moreta, a felis 
    with black fur and black eyes, is here".
`W
    POSE by itself displays your current pose and whether it's on or off,
    or a message saying you don't have a pose.
`W
    POSE <text> will set your pose to the given text.
`W
    POSE OFF will disable your pose. It will not erase it, but people in
    the room will not see your pose.
`W
    POSE ON will turn your pose back on, if you have one.
`W

 `W       
    Syntax: `Gzap <target>
`W
    Harnessing various magics into inanimate objects is a process which
    has been mastered for centuries by mages of the Academie.  While not
    an exact science enabling them to place spells of their full power
    on to an item, it can be quite useful.  Wands can carry more charges
    than a scroll can, and can be made quite small and lightweight for 
    carrying.  To zap with a wand it must be held.  There is always a 
    chance that a wand can explode upon releasing the magics inside it, 
    so some mages are very wary of their use.

    Syntax: `Grecite <scroll> <target>
`W
    Scrolls are another of magic's conveniences.  One use of magical
    items such as scrolls, is to hold a spell or spells power locked
    into a piece of parchment, the magic just waiting to be released.  
    However scrolls are a luxury as well.  For any follower of magic 
    can tell you that one must have deep pockets to delve into this 
    luxury, not to mention the ability to read, and sometimes read 
    quickly and without thinking about the sword or mace aimed at 
    one's head.

    Staves are magical items that can be handled by those who follow the
    path of magic.  Staves are a convenient way for any spellcaster to 
    perform their magic without having to use personal stores of energy.  
    The magic user holds the staff to brandish it. Staves can contain 
    any of number or type of spell and the truly experienced spell
    caster has sometimes had luck in recharging them. Don't be fooled 
    though,  for once it has been recharged once and the magic runs out
    the staff is no longer of any use.  It should be noted that a
    staff may not always be magical in nature but a mere weapon.

`W
    Dissolving nearly anything it touches, acid is an incredibly powerful
    substance, made even more powerful by the well trained invoker.  When
    shot out at a target in a tight stream, the acid of this incantation 
    is one of the most damaging and most painful spells that any invoker
    can cast.  As with other powerful spells, it is highly recommended that
    spells of lesser power and intensity be learned, and mastered, first.

`C    ACID RAIN

`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'acid rain' <target>
`W
    An angry elementalist is a serious force to be reckoned with, 
    especially when its sacred groves and forests are polluted.  The 
    elementalist, in an attempt to purify the forests and groves it 
    loves so much, literally sucks the poisonous wastes from the land 
    and air and with the very rain, drops this acidic mixture upon 
    those that would harm its home.  Not many people can withstand the 
    effect of the acids burning their flesh and armor and so victims 
    usually flee towards the nearest river.

`W
    This spell allows a trained person to stimulate and control the 
    adrenaline that is produced within their body.   As the spell is 
    called a burst of adrenaline is released into the bloodstream 
    resulting in numerous short term effects throughout the body.   
    It increases the heart rate, dilates the pupils, it makes the skin 
    less permeable to attack, and even stimulates the muscles making 
    one hit even harder.

`W
    Animal summoning is one of the mainstays of those who follow the
    path of nature.  Working only in forested areas, an elementalist
    and hunter can call forth one of the creatures of the forest to do 
    their bidding for a short period of time.  Animals held in thrall
    in this manner cannot have companions, it is a bond of a single 
    animal and the follower of nature.

    have proven themselves worthy of such power.   The ability to cast
    a spell upon ones self, a spell that produces an overwhelming feeling
    of peace, so strong the person is protected for a short time from any
    violence. However the use of the spell brings a cost to the caster 
    drawing heavily on their magical stores of energy.  In addition, the

`W
    Trees can withstand amazing amounts of punishment, from weather,
    wind, or physical damage.  Most of their protection comes from
    the thick layer of bark which surrounds the exterior of the tree.
    Elementalists and hunters have found a way to harness this natural
    armor to aid them in the protection of themseves on their journeys.
    While not nearly as permanent and strong as normal treebark, the 
    armor from this spell is quite sturdy and while it lasts, does a 
    fine job of protecting the recipient of the spell.

    Syntax: `Gcast barrage <target>
`W
    Rainbows are nothing but water droplets reflecting rays of light,
    quite harmless under most circumstances.  Elementalists have the 
    ability, with some training, to harness simple rays of light, 
    similar to a rainbow, except with much more devestating effects 
    than the colorful displays in the sky after a rainstorm.  Aiming a
    ray of light with nothing more than usually a mirror or fragment 
    of glass, an elementalist can sometimes completely obliterate a 
    target with the dazzling barrage of light, sometimes leaving an 
    afterimage of a beautiful rainbow.  Such an affect often may leave 
    the recipient of the spell blinded for a short time.

`C    RECALLING
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Syntax: `Grecall`W
`W
     It is known that the gods favor the young and the adventurous
     and proves such by bestowing of the ability to recall when
     they are still of ranking ten or less.  All one needs to do is
     focus and they find themselves back at a safe place, where they 
     can rest and heal.  But it is also known fate is fickle, and 
     this ability vanishes after the individual has grown wiser in
     their ranking.
`W
     If the young one attempts to recall during combat it is not guaranteed
     to be successful and if it is, experience will be lost. A successful 
     recall will also cost half your movement points.
`W
     The young should also be aware that recall doesn't work everywhere
     and that cursed people can not recall.

`C    FELIS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The Felis are a race of cat people that exist in the cellars
    of legends and dreams.  The average felis stands between six
    and eight feet.  They are extremely lithe and agile and move
    with a natural grace that often defies description.  Their fur
    is quite random, usually the color of any of the great cats but
    most often, the rustic tawny of lions.  They live in great prides
    and make incredible soldiers, hunters, rogues, mages, elementalists,
    or mystics.  While they would be adequate assassins, their strict
    code of honor prohibits this.

`C    GOBLINS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    These small humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their 
    sheer numbers.  Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, ears with 
    incredibly sharp points, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs.
    Their eyes are usually dull and glazed.  Their skin colors range
    anywhere from yellow through shades of red and orange.  Goblins
    are extremely malicious and sadistic, preferring to torture their
    enemies for long periods of time before killing, and eventually
    eating them.  Because of their cowardly nature, goblins can easily
    be at home in the shadows and make excellent rogues.  Their small 
    size and only average intelligent make them acceptable soldiers, 
    mystics, and necromancers.

`C    HALFLINGS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The small form of the halfling, which is about half the size
    of a human, is very beneficial to them.  Their compact bodies 
    resist poisons and diseases, and halflings are experts at moving
    silently.  However, as the halflings were persecuted throughout
    history they used their small bodies to turn to thievery and
    lockpicking when there was nothing else to turn to.  As family
    trades were passed on from generation to generation halflings
    became experts at pickings locks and usually pass through most
    doors without even thinking about it.  The science of alchemy has
    also been a successful area of study by halflings over the years.

`C    KENKUS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy
    and inconvenience the human and demihuman races.  The typical kenku
    resembles a humanoid hawk wearing human clothing.  Kenku have both
    arms and wings.  The wings are usually folded across the back and
    may be mistaken at a distance for a very large backpack.  Their 
    height ranges from 5 to 7 feet and their plumage may be auburn, 
    brown, or black sometimes with white underfeathers and face markings.
    Their eyes are often a brilliant yellow but may also be emerald or red.
`W
    Kenku are curious beings who tend to be fascinated with the interaction
    of other races.  This has resulted in many of them being trained as
    elementalists, mages, and mystics.  Others have adapted their skills 
    toward studying the ways of hunters and soldiers.

`C    MINOTAURS

`W
    The race of minotaurs is one of honor and discipline.  Natural
    seafarers, they are usually found near or about islands, or upon 
    boats of all kind plying their trades.  Minotaurs are huge, well
    over 7 feet tall, and quite broad and muscular.  They have the 
    head of a bull but the body of a human. Their fur can be a variety
    of colors while their eyes range as would a human.  Minotaurs have a
    natural sense of direction and are incredibly hard to trap, giving
    them excellent abilities as soldiers and hunters.  On the flip side,
    they are a very superstitious race, and are not as wise as they 
    should be.  However they still make acceptable mystics and 
    elementalists.

`C    SHADOWS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Little is known of the Ethereal race that roams Forsaken, hence
    they are collectively known as 'shadows'.  Shadows are quasi
    undead creatures that were dragged to E'dhora through one of the
    many rifts that opened following the cataclysm.  Their natural
    state of "hiding" makes them formidable rogues and even better
    assassins.  While having many of the weaknesses that other undead
    share, they also have many of the strengths as well.  Their study 
    of the dark arts gives them the ability to perform well as 
    necromancers and their ability to fight makes them good soldiers.

`W
    Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids,
    and theft.  Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found
    serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes or for evil 
    clerics.  Adult ogres stand 8 to 10 feet tall and weight 400 to
    800 pounds.  Their skin tones range from a dead yellow to a dull
    black-brown, and rarely a sickly violet.  Their eyes are a variety of
    colors usually with white pupils.  Ogres have long, greasy hair of 
    different shades and styles.  Contrary to their looks, ogres are 
    quite intelligent and some of the most powerful necromancers are ogres.
    Their phenomenal strength makes them natural soldiers.

`C    ORCS
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band
    together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding.  Orcs look
    much like primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse
    hair of various colors.  Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low
    jutting forehead and a snout instead of a nose.  Their eyes are human,
    with a variety of tints that sometimes make them appear to glow red 
    when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness.  Orcs have 
    limited infravision and their naturally dull demeanor makes them 
    poor choices for mages or mystics.  However, due to their natural 
    aggression, and natural stealth, orcs make near perfect choices 
    for rogues, soldiers, and necromancers.  In fact it is said an 
    orc without a sword is useless.

    Thri-Kreen are a race of intelligent insects often known as 
    "mantis-soldiers".  They roam the deserts and savannahs, where
    they have marked-out hunting territories.  They have no need of
    sleep and can remain active throughout the day and night.
`W
    Adult thri-kreen are roughly 4 feet at the shoulder and 7 feet
    long.  Of the six limbs protruding from their midsection, two are
    used for walking; the other four end in four-fingered hands.  Their
    hard exo-skeleton acts as natural armor and protects the insect
    from many attacks. The thri-kreen tend to be successful soldiers 
    and hunters.

`C    OXALIS    
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The Oxalis are a small jovial crystalline race that came into 
    existence shortly after the Day of Absolution. The crystalline
    skin that covers their body is extremely hard and tends to focus
    the light intensifying its effects on them producing a negative 
    effect.   They are between one to three feet in height and rarely
    weigh more than five pounds. They have strong wings that are 
    leathery and either translucent or colored like any of the myriad
    mineral stones.  The color of their crystals and eyes vary depending
    on where they emerged and grew up.  A few Oxalis are so transparent
    that their small heart can be seen beating within their body.
`W
    Oxalis are very intelligent and that leads them to study successfully
    as alchemists, elementalists, and mages.  They also tend to have a 
    shady and frisky personality that leads them to be successful as 
    rogues.

    TROLLS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
Huge moving, living rocks of humanoid shape, with intelligence and 
personality: in other words, trolls are sentient beings. Trolls have 
interesting seams of valuable minerals as their blood vessels and nervous 
system. This phenomenon has at least two repercussions. One: a troll's brain, 
silicon-based, will overheat and slow down in Ankh-Morpork  (where everyone 
wants to live), and the troll will become sadly stupid; the brain will also 
overheat in strong sun, causing trolls to stop moving in daylight. Two: 
when a troll has stopped moving while his brain has overheated in daylight, 
this troll will look just like a lump of rock, with interesting seams of 
valuable minerals, and may be (and have been) attacked by mining dwarfs. 

This is very likely the initial cause of the animosity between  trolls and 
dwarfs, even though, after hundreds of years, the feud goes on because it 
is a cultural tradition for both species. It being a cultural tradition does 
not mean it is nice; trolls and dwarfs have repeated the Battle of Koom Valley 
several times, each side springing an ambush on the other, casualties are high. 
The hostility lives on and is found in any place with a significant number of 
both species.

`W
    Drow are similar in physical build to elves, but of slightly shorter
    stature.  Unlike land elves, Drow have black or tanned skin and black,
    brown, green, grey, hazel, or white eyes.  Their hair color can be 
    white, black, brown, or varying shades of grey.  Drow tend to be a 
    sub-terranian race, possessing infravision with which to see in the 
    dark.  This sensitivity in the dark however, makes it difficult to see
    in the daytime.  
`W
    The drow believe that they and not the elves are the true first children
    and thus it is their duty to subjugate all other races.  The drows are
    often known for their cold demeanor to all other races, this emotion is
    accompanied by cruelty for which the drow are well known.  They consider
    their elven-kin their only equals and thus, the only real threat to their
    dominance.  Their feelings for their kin range from cold hatred, envy and
    a secret twisted desire to be accepted, feelings that stemmed from some 
    event that took place hundreds of years ago, an event never spoken of.
`W
    Over time many of the drow race have become well know for their work 
    as alchemist, mages, and necromancers.  However they also tend to be
    successful soldiers and rogues.

`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    HOW TO WRITE A NOTE
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`W
    The follow takes you step-by-step how to write a note:
`W
    1. Select an appropriate board.  
       - List them by typing "boards" if necessary.
       - If the board you want isn't your current board, type "boards" 
         followed by the name of the board you want.
`W
    2. Type "note to" followed by whoever you want to see the note.  
       - This can be a name or list of names.  
       - It could also be the word "all", which means everybody.     
       - It can be a number (level).  All players of that level and higher 
         will be able to read the note.
       - It can be a clan name.   
       - It can be "imm", "imms" or "immortals".  All immortals will see it.
       - It can be "admin" or "administrators"; the admins of the mud only 
         will see it.
       - It can be "imp", "imps" or "implementors", the imps of the mud only
         will see it.
       - It can be "coder" or "coders"; the coding staff only will see it.
       - It can be any of all of the above.
`W
    3. Next you type "note subject", follow by the subject of the note.  This 
       should generaly be a short phrase of no more than a few words.
`W
    4. Now you can write the main body of the note.  You can enter it a line 
       at a time by typing "note +" followed by the next line to add.  
       Alternatively, you can type "note write" and use a very simple text
       editor.  
`W
       You can remove the last line of the note by typing "note -".  This
       would normally be used if you make a typo while using "note +".
`W
       At any time while writing the note you can type "note show" to see 
       the note so far.
`W
    5. When you're finished you can type either "note post" or "note send"
       to actually send the note.

`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'burning hands' <victim>
`W
      Fire, no matter in what amount or strength, is a formidable foe,
      able to spread and destroy quickly.  When cast, this spell
      envelops the caster's hand in a magical green fire able to do
      damage to a foe.  This spell does little damage in comparison to
      other spells which a mage may learn later in training, but this
      is a fairly strong predicessor to some of the most feared spells
      in a mage's arsenal.

`W
    Syntax: `Gcast 'dispel magic' <target>
`W
    For as long as there have been those casting magical spells,
    there have been attempts to remove the affects of magic once cast.
    This spell is the best example of an incantation used for this
    purpose.  Once cast, this spell does not look for beneficial or
    detrimental magics, it simply attempts to break down the dweomer
    of the spells thus removing them.  This spell is not always
    considered a friendly one, and can be used "offensively" during
    combat with someone enspelled.

`W
    Consisting mainly of simple light, this spell flings forth bright
    rays of colorful light from the fingers of the caster.  This spell
    marks where an illusionist starts to gain the ability to twist
    commonly found items and things, such as light, into a powerful
    magical weapon.  While not among the more powerful spells in a
    mages' arsenal, colour spray is not to be looked down at, or
    trifled, for many a foe has fallen to nothing more than a pretty
    bunch of lights in their face.

`W
    Drawing moisture from the air around them, an invoker may cast
    this powerful chilling spell, covering everything near them with
    ice and snow.  Physically taxing on the mage themselves, this is
    not an overly common spell to be seen cast, but it has its uses
    to be sure, and is to be feared greatly.

    a mystic walking down the streets of a poverty-stricken town,
    singing hymns about their respective gods, giving people a pat
    on the back, among other things.  When an adventurer is near death,
    the cure spells can keep him or her alive.  This is the strongest
    of the curative spells, and is not surpassed for a great deal of a

    Syntax: `Gembark <ship name>
            `Gleave 
`W
    Different types of ships and boats can be seen throughout E'dhora.  
    One type of vessel that is common is sailing vessels.  These vessels 
    have owners or may be common vessels for any traveler to use.  The 
    vessels that have owners have set times they arrive and leave at 
    different port locations across the continents.  The other type of 
    sailing ship has the ability to move from one place to another at the 
    control of the player.  These sailing ships may be found while docked 
    at a port or be grounded along the sand of a white beach.  They have 
    the ability to sail across the ocean, up rivers, or even into a lake, 
    completely at the control of the player.
`W
    When these ships are found, a player may board them using the command 
    "embark <ship name>".  Once aboard, the player can control the ship by 
    using the sail command.  
`W
    At this point if multiple players attempt to sail the ship, the person 
    who grabs the wheel fastest or types the quickest will gain control of 
    the vessel.
`W
    While on the ship if a traveler types "look", they will first see the 
    description of the ship itself, then the name of any others that may 
    also be on the ship with them, and lastly location that is around them.
`W
    Once the journey on the ship is completed, players may exit the ship 
    by using the command "leave".  The ship will be visible in the location 
    until the next traveler takes it out for an adventure.

            `Gsteer <direction>    
`W
    Once aboard a ship, the player can control its movement by using the 
    command "sail <direction>".  A player must be aware of weather conditions 
    when sailing a ship because it takes wind to make the sailing ship move.  
    It is impossible to sail directly into the wind and different wind speeds 
    will determine how fast the ship moves from one location to another. To 
    see the weather conditions, type "weather". 
`W
    Steer <direction> is another way to change the direction of the ship.  
`W    
    If, while in control of a ship, you type 'north' then the ship moves north
    (unless it's a 2-room ship and you're in the southern end).  If you type 
    'sail north' it will continue to move north repeatedly until the wind dies, 
    it hits land, or you type 'sail stop'

    Launch will place a vehicle such as a ship into the world, allowing
    it to be controlled thereafter by players.

    The location can be given as a vnum, the name of a mobile, or the name
    of an object.  The location must be suitable for the type of vehicle;
    you cannot launch a ship in the mountains, for example.

    The vehicle may already be in a room at the time of launch.  In this
    case the lauch effectively transfers the vehicle, much like the

    Unlaunch will remove a vehicle such as a ship from the world.  It does
    not destroy the ship, it simply removes it from the room it's in.

    If you're in the vehicle you wish to unlaunch, simply type "unlaunch"
    by itself.  Otherwise, specify the vehicle as a vnum, or by naming a
    mobile or object in the vehicle.

    Syntax: `Groad
`W
    Over the years, roads have been constructed throughout the world to help 
    with transportation.  While on a road, a player has the option to use 
    the command road.  When the command is used, the player will follow the 
    twists and turns of the road until they reach a fork.  At that point a 
    decision of what direction you want to go will need to be made.   
 `W
    When you type road at a fork, the possible directions will be displayed,

1 Seraphim MARS~
MARS is a Multi-Adventurer Roleplaying System, and the goal is to create a MUD
base that can be used to create huge worlds of imagination. We want to build out
the basic world map, then each of the main cities. After that, it will be a matter
of populating the world with unique areas! Any idea that fits in a general fantasy
setting will work for the MARS base. Once you create it, then we will find a place
together where it will fit best in the world map, and link it there.

Please be aware that once MARS reaches a mostly complete state, where there are enough
areas for players to reach the maximum level without having to re-run the same area
over and over again, and all of the races and classes have been fully play-tested
and rebalanced, the areas created for MARS will become part of the base release
and when MARS is released to the public on github and various MUD code repositories
the areas built for MARS will be distributed along with the source code.

1 Seraphim ZOMBIE~
`c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ZOMBIE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`X

Walking corpses, many of whom are still intelligent, usually from the 
human species. No dwarf, gnome, pictsie, or troll zombies have been 
reported. Also, no zombies reported to be from ordinary animal species. 
Many zombies can still see, hear, smell, talk, move, think, plan, and scheme. 
Some can even eat. Depending on length of time since death, a zombie's flesh 
may look gray or green, his skin may be flaking off, he may smell rotten or 
smell of preservatives. When "injured", for example a finger having been cut 
off, a zombie does not bleed; the wound can be sewn up, but there will be no 
wound-healing or tissue-regeneration.

The process of death strips away all illusions, so a zombie, if he wishes, can 
control all his body functions extremely well, and think very clear thoughts. 
For this reason, a zombie can be a powerful fighter. Their bodily strength is 
so great that they are supposedly able to walk through walls and rip people 
apart just like that. Notable zombies in Ankh-Morpork include Mr. Slant the 
head of the Guild of Lawyers, Mr Bendy, the obituarist on The Times, and the 
Watchman Reg Shoe, also a dead rights activist. 

Several reasons might cause a corpse to continue walking around and talking 
to people. The most prominent reason is magic. Corpses can be resurrected by 
application of proper spells and/or potions. Gods are also known for fiddling 
around with human bodies. At least one case is known, where a person continued 
to walk around after his death, simply because Death had not come around to 
collect his soul. In a related fashion, some become zombies merely because 
their life-timers have not run out at the point of their death.

`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    DRAGONBORN
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a 
world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or 
the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique 
race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are 
faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, 
and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
 
Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they 
lack wings. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the 
colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more 
uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, 
sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly 
built, often standing close to 6 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. 
Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on 
each hand.
 
The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. 
These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon 
ancestorbright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, 
silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

`C    TIEFLINGS
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the 
street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. 
And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck 
generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeusoverlord of the Nine Hellsinto 
their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the 
result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their childrens 
children will always be held accountable.
 
Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, 
they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint 
on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of 
shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns 
like a gazelles, and some spiral upward like an antelopes horns. They have 
thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when 
they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes 
are solid colorsblack, red, white, silver, or goldwith no visible sclera or pupil. 
Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various 
shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, 
from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.

0 Seraphim GNOMES~
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    GNOMES
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods 
where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate 
the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp 
of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take 
delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, 
investigation, creation, and play.
 
A gnomes energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his 
or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 
40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad 
smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with 
excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, 
as if expressing the gnomes insatiable interest in everything around.
A gnomes personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male 
gnomes beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but 
often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnomes clothing, though 
usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, 
embossing, or gleaming jewels.

0 Seraphim HALFELVES HALF-ELVES HALFELF HALF-ELF~
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    HALF ELVES
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what 
some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity,
inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and 
artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by 
their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age 
while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as 
they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to
live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose 
lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the 
adventuring life.
 
To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height,
theyre on par with both parents, though theyre neither as slender as elves nor
as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 
100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. 
Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven 
ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human 
and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found 
among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.

`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    HALF ORCS
`C-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
`X
Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a 
standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form 
alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands 
nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some 
half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving 
them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to 
prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these 
become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for
their barbaric customs and savage fury.
 
Half-orcs grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent 
teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. 
Half-orcs stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 
250 pounds.
 
Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of 
beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a 
disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, 
whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past 
exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these 
scars proudly or hide them in shame.

Visitor Seraphim JOBS 'IMMORTAL JOBS' 'IMMORTAL ROLES' ROLES~
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`C    IMMORTAL JOBS AND ROLES
`c-------------------------------------------------------------------------------`X
 
These are the roles/jobs of Immortals on MARS:
 
`POwner`X - Om. Pretty self explanatory. Om owns this place. His word is final.
 
`CCoder`X - The responsibilties of the coders are to implement code changes 
and fix bugs that arise. You likely won't interact with coders very often
if at all, as they spend most of their time in a terminal or coding environment
and not be logged into MARS. While they are a higher level than any other
Immortal besides Om, their focus is not on the disciplinary actions and 
running of quests. They have a higher Immortal level because they are trusted
with commands that should not be accessible to lower level Immortals.
 
This does not mean that they do not deserve the respect of their level,
quite the contrary, they keep MARS running and add new and exciting features
and that makes them among the most valuable members of the MARS team.

`bAdmins`X - Admins are responsible for the day-to-day operation of MARS.
This includes the management of disciplinary actions against mortals and 
even other gods. Admins will spend most of their time wizinvis so that the
only ones who even know they're online and watching are Om and the coders.

`gPR`X/`pSecurity`X - These are actually two sepearate jobs that share the 
same level. PR's job is to advertise MARS to the world and try to bring in 
new players. However, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, advertise on another
MUD unless the staff there has given express oncsent ahead of time.

Advertising on other MUDs will result in immediate removal from the PR position.

Security is in charge of the security of MARS. This includes making note of multiple
failed login attempts and IP banning someone who fails to login multiple times on 
one character and then successfully logs in with another character that is not known
to be played by the same player. 

`GHead Builder`X - Head Builder is a position earned through experience and the
demonstration of skill in writing, storytelling, and an understanding of how
the On-Line Creation system (OLC) of MARS functions. The Head Builder is 
responsible for overseeing Trainee Builders and approval of areas created
by all class of Builder, even the Senior Builders. The Head Builder, when
satisfied with an area, will link the new area to the main world so that
players can explore and enjoy it.
 
`YSenior Builders`X - Senior Builders are Builders that have create 3 or more
areas of 100 rooms or more in MARS and had them linked to the main world by
the Head Builder. It is up to the Head Builder and Om to decide if a Builder
who has reached this requirement is 'ready' for the promotion to Senior Builder.

`RBuilders`X - Builders are no longer considered Trainees after the completion of
their first full area of 100 rooms or more that has been approved and linked
by the Head Builder to the main world.
 
`OTrainee Builders`X - Trainee Builders are Builders who have not yet completed
their first area, or have no OLC experience and are in the process of being
trained on how to build areas for MARS.
 
`BQuestors`X - Questors are Immortals that create and run quest for the mortals
and help drive the story and roleplay of MARS. Questors are given a basic story
framework for what the mainline plot of MARS is at present, so that they may
create quests to operate as story hooks to involve the player base and make
them an active part of the story so that every player, no matter their level
or equipment, can feel like they had a hand in shaping the world around them.

Trainee Questors are pretty self explanatory.

tiger~
a tiger~
A tiger stands at rest here.
~
Sleek and regal, the tiger's eyes seem to glow with a predatory gleam.

unseen force.

A greater golem stands here looking very dangerous.
~
The golem stands taller than most humans, and looks to be made out of
formed and molded earth or clay.  It has no eyes, but there is little doubt
that it can see.  While it moves slowly, it seems to always know where to be
just before an enemy is there itself.
