own, as if scouring your soul.  She is the leader of the Laerkai, the
elite protective force of the race, a rank which she has won through
centuries of power and loyalty.  Though each of the six Laerkai beneath
her represents a single house and excels in that house's specialty,
the master comes from a union between the Deriki and Myrxes houses.
Trained by both, she has become a lethal blend of sorcery and stealth.

The Mediator~
Shifting grey light pervades the room.

The light seems to shift and change even as you look at it.  This is

their lives to the increase of wisdom and willingly gave their souls
in death to serve the council.  The Mediator resides over the council
when it is in session and resolves disputes.  Due to its ancient wisdom,
it passes the final judgment on all issues that affect the race as a whole.

blue marble fountain~
Blue marble, so dark as to appear black in patches where shadows have
fallen over the stone, has been sculpted into the form of a tall
sorceress, hands raised in the act of casting a spell.  Crystalline
water splashes from the sorceress' open palm, sparkling like colour
spray in the light.  The narrow face and chiseled cheekbones appear
elven, but twin wings rise from the shoulderblades, sculpted feathers
cascading over the sorceress' back like a cloak.

was just your imagination?  The water sparkles in the light.

Strange Grove~
The air seems strangely silent here, devoid even of birdsong.  Tall trees
frame the clearing, their leaves motionless in the still air.  In the
center of the clearing rests a circular pool of clear water.  A narrow
path leads into the forest to the north.  A dark stone plaque lies
next to the pool, nearly buried in the grass.

Silvery Gates~
You find yourself on a dirt path before a tall gateway.  The double
gates gleam silvery blue in the light, formed of fine bars of mithril
interwoven into an intricate, twisting pattern.  Though the bars are
spaced widely apart in places, you can't seem to see what lays beyond.

Polished jade forms the walls of a short north-south corridor, the
green of the stone fading from dark to light and back again.
The walls seem to glow with an inner light, giving the darker portions
the impression of long patches of phosphorescent moss.  A white
door leads east and a glass door south.  The corridor continues west.
