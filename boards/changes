New Change: Random equipment drops.
 
Now when you kill a mobile, you will likely get a piece of gear.
Even if you don't see it equipped to them or in their inventory, every mobile
now has a chance to drop a totally randomized piece of gear and each piece
is unique, but not all of them are beneficial.
 
Each piece is of four different rarities:
-Mastercrafted. This is the best, and adds significant value
-Plain. This will have no special prefix, it's just plain.
-Heavily-used. This is lesser quality, lesser value.
-Cursed. This is worst quality, lowest value, and often comes with a nasty drawback.
 
Each piece also has a chance to have a random enchantment:
-Various spells. These are permanent spell effects such as flight, regeneration, haste, sanctuary etc
-Lesser bonuses. These are +1 to stats, +5 to hp, mana, move, -1 to saves, etc
-Regular bonuses. These are +2 to stats, +10 to hp, mana, move, and -2 to saves, etc
-Greater bonuses. These are +3 to stats, +20 to hp, mana, move, and -5 to saves, etc.
They also come in negative versions as well, such as vulnerability to fire, cold, lighting, etc
as well as negative stats, hp, mana, move, etc. 
 
Example: Mastercrafted Ring of Greater Nimbleness - This would have an increased value, and add +3 dex as ell as other bonuses.
Cursed Armor of Sensitivity to Light - This would have a negative effect, be worth the least money, as well as add vulnerability to light dmg.

Subject some changes~
Text
Changes: Level requirements for using weapons and armor are removed.
They will be replaced with stat requirements, though. For example
if you have a low Strength score, you will not be able to wield a 
heavy weapon in your off-hand.
 
Additionally, the weight requirement of your off-hand weapon needing to be lighter than
your primary has been removed. That has never made sense to me as the
most proficient two-handed fighters often use weapons that are equal in
weight and balance.
 
Age command added. 
This command will show your age in MARS time, actual hours played, and 
your number of logins.

Subject Change to sit,rest,sleep~
Text
You may now sit, rest and sleep on items in your inventory.

No longer will you have to 'drop bedroll', 'sleep bedroll', 'get bedroll'
and forget the dang thing half the time, rushing back to hope that no players or
trash collector mobiles have absconded with your favorite bedroll you 
took all that time to break in and make just the way you like it.
 
Now you can target an item in your inventory that is able to be sat,rested
or slept upon.  'sit bedroll' for example, will automatically drop your
bedroll and you will sit on it, and when you stand up you will automatically grab it.
This also works with rest and sleep.

Subject Dragonborn Breathe command~
Text
Dragonborn now have access to the 'breathe' command, which will activate
a breath weapon dependent on the type of dragon they're descended from.
 
Black and Copper dragons - Acid Breath
Blue and Bronze dragons - Lightning breath
Brass, Gold and Red dragons - Fire breath
Green dragons - Poison breath
Silver and White dragons - Frost breath
 
There is a steep mana cost and time delay after using your breath weapon
so it is not something you will want to spam. Additionally, if it's an AoE breath weapon
and there are no enemies present, you will damage yourself with it. So be careful!

Fighters and Druids will now have access to the tracking skill.
 
Tracking a mobile or player will tell you which direction, from

Let's just say the results will be less than accurate.

Spell memorization is IN!
 
Casters get spell slots each level. There are 10 'caster levels'
and each level you earn new slots in a caster level. 
 
If you want to know how many slots of each spell level you
have available you can type 'slots' and that 
will show you how many of each level you have.
If you want to memorize a spell, you simply type 'memorize <spell>'
If you want to forget a spell memorized, 'forget <spell>'
To see what spells you have memorized already, 'memlist'
 
The table of spell slots will be available under HELP SPELLSLOTS

New classes: barbarian, bard, monk and paladin
 
Barbarian - Will have access to many of the same skills as a
fighter, but will also have the ability to rage, increasing
their combat effectiveness for a short time.
 
Bard - part rogue, part spellcaster, bards are able to cast
spells through a musical instrument focus and have access
to powerful buff spells to aid their companions in battle.
 
Monk - An unarmed fighting class, the monk can unleash powerful
attacks that can daze and stun their opponents and combat techniques
that can give them the advantage in battle.
 
Paladin - A holy warrior, paladins fight for their deity and for law.
Paladins are more combat adept than clerics, but lack as many divine
spells. Though a paladin may 'lay on hands', sacrificing much of their
health and mana to restore another.

Subject skill/spells sorting~
Text
I've begun sorting skills and spells by class.
 
One thing you will notice is that if you are a class
that can cast spells, you have no spells above level 10
 
This is not in error. There are 10 'caster levels', and
with each character level you gain spells slots and increase
your caster level.
 
e.g. A level 7 Mage would have a caster level of 4, and be able
to cast 6 level 1 spells, 6 level 2 spells, 6 level 3 spells, and 
4 level 4 spells. At character level 8, the caster level would go
up to 5 and the mage would gain an additional level 4 spell, as 
well as 3 level 5 spells. There is a full chart in 'help SPELLSLOTS'

Subject bow/crossbow~
Text
Bows and crossbows are in. They are not for prolonged combat,
but rather as a combat opener as the average 'room' in MARS
is 10' x 10' and it's assumed that in the time it takes to
draw an arrow from your quiver, nock/load it, and fire that
your opponent will have closed the distance to melee range
by the time they're struck with the arrow.
 
Now, I've taken a little liberties with how the system works...
the only thing you cannot be doing while using a bow is dual wielding
In real life, soldiers in middle age Hungary were known to have a shield on
one arm, hold the bow with that same hand, wield a 1h weapon in
their other hand, and load/draw/fire a bow then
immediately be able to drop the bow (tethered to their belt)
and enter into melee combat with a 1h weapon and shield.
 
So that's how I designed this system. It will primarily be for
the Ranger class once it's added, and it is assumed that since
it's one of their specialties, a fantasy ranger can at least
do what a real life human being in the middle agees could do.

Text
Summon Monster spell is IN! 
 
Instead of creating a separate spell for each version of Summon Monster, 
I opted to make it a single spell that checks your level, and then
summons from a pool of monsters for your level and alignment.
 
e.g. If you're level 2 it will act as Summon Monster I and only the
monsters from Summon Monster I will appear. But if you cast it at level 3
You will instead get a monster from Summon Monster II.
 
At present only monsters from I and II are available, but I will
be adding all the way to IX

Barbarians can now rage, raising their hitroll and damroll by an
absolutely absurd amount, but also raising their AC an equally
absurd amount. Barbarians can rage for a very, very short amount
of time making themselves extremely deadly, but also pretty squishy.
 
And afterwards they're exhausted and unable to rage again for
quite some time.
